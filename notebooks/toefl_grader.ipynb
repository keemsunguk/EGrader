       "  '56. \"governments should focus more on solving the immediate problems of today rather than trying to solve the anticipated problems of the future.\"    since the democratic governments appeared in the history, they have served to unravel social problems promising a certain extent of welfare to their peoples. as long as they handle various kinds of policies targeting social problems, governments are forced to make decision between the two rabbits: current  difficulties or anticipated problems, simply. though the governments would get much more applause to the people as they concentrate on the confronted problems, i will say it is rather adequate to focus on the expected problems of the future.    actually many of the current problems seem to be the ex post facto difficulties while the future ones are mostly asked how to prevent it. no prize for guessing which ones are smooth to deal with. thus governments would get efficiency as they try to prevent the social problems forecasted. a preventing of disaster among one government projects is a good example in this respect. there are some safety devices in our society government established to forestall the latent disasters such as a institutional or structural fire preventing systems. peoples may have wonder why all that systems are set and maintained at the expense of the national treasury while other imminent problems are moved back in the second place, and they may even grumble over it. but as it says, \"a stitch in time saves nine,\" the cost of proper prevention can be smaller than that to cure a disaster after taking place. considering a budget constraint of the governments, prevention project, which is relatively less burdensome allows the government to carry out a lot. an ox plows up more at the same fodder will be welcomed.    but what about the grouching peoples? indeed, it is the people\\'s jobs to petition their government for immediate actions that would work advantageously for their demand. however, what they call for are in most case myopic or at least localized, missing a perspective of its impact on the society as a whole. although the national voice should be heard loud to the government so it seems reasonable for government to focus on current urging problems, the reason above asserts that they must present a long-term guideline to the people. what is depressing with the narrow-minded peoples or interest group in terms of the society\\'s prosperity and the improvement of social welfare, is clearly pictured in an example of seoul city\\'s afforestation plan in korea. recently seoul city announced that she was planning to restore the natural scenery around the tributary of han river where a lot of somber street stalls sprawled out along the both side so far. undoubtedly all merchants of the area rose against the policy as their commercial rights were in danger of vanishing. what if the city government are trying to be indulgent to them and retract the afforestation project? maintenance of the status quo; the same satisfactions of the merchants, dreary city zone all the way around, no improvement before it is too late. in this case, the city government should cling to the very first idea taking a long view that such a afforestation, with a reasonable compensation for removal, will not only conduce to the citizen\\'s welfare, but also surely be beneficial to the tourism which will gratify the merchants, too, all in the course of time.    simply put, most of the current problems are dependent on the people\\'s provincial needs and that will readily harm the society\\'s bigger gains. thus it is not until the governments try to solve anticipated future problems, which is relatively unagitated from every voice makes different sounds in different places, that they can keep their policy in consistency leading to the bigger gains on schedule.    finally, there exists a time-lag in the government policy. that is, a certain period of time is taken in the subsequent process of recognizing a problem, policy-making against that problem, and carrying out the policy. also they hardly can expect the direct outcome after the policy is applied in the real world. that means a very current problem may be too late to deal with.    several reasons suggest the government to keep their eyes on the coming future. provident policies going after future problems lessen the burden of a limited budget. and the governments can concentrate at the tasks of solving the problems free from the discomfiting demands of the short-sighted peoples and from the time-lag difficulty, only if those problems are anticipated future ones.'),\n",

       "  'i agree with the statement insofar as all observation is subjective. however, i think that there is another thing that guides the observation as well as the observer\\'s expectations.   people always observe something with their own goggles colored by their expectations. for example, there is a korean saying, \"are your eyes covered with a bean hull?\" it is used to jeer the lovers who indulge in finding out the merit of mate in order to convince that the mate is good. if they are parted after severe quarrel, they can see obviously the defect of mate they have never seen before, because they want to confirm that he or she is enough bad to dump.  but, what guide the observation is not only the expectation but also the knowledge of observers. some years ago, the essay of professor yoo, \"my exploratory reports of cultural assets\", was popular. in his book, he frequently used the word, \"you can see as you know.\" when observing the cultural assets, the more learned you are about historical backgrounds, the better you observe the cultural assets. it is just a timeworn stone until you know that it is the stone monument of keeping the bone of the famous priest. it is certain that there is a distinctive difference between observations made by leering and observing carefully after you learned.  in addition, the observation is reflected by the sex and interest of people. for example, after people meet an unfamiliar girl for a moment, let they speak what they observe. then, men generally answered only one or two thing about the girl. but women answered almost all about the girl-the hair, the color of lip, the clothes, the shoes, and so on. also, you must have experienced that you can only see something you are going to purchase. if you have a plan to purchase a muffler, then you must observe only the muffler of passers on the road. in other words, the sex and interest can make people observe something selectively.  in summary, all observation is subjective. and, it is guided by not only the observer\\'s expectation but also the personal character-the knowledge, the interest, and the sex.'),\n",

Groveton's honor code replaced an old-fashioned system in which students were closely monitored by teachers and an average of thirty cases of cheating per year were reported. The honor code has proven far more successful: in the first year it was in place, students reported twenty-one cases of cheating; five years later, this figure had dropped to fourteen. Moreover, in a recent survey conducted by the Groveton honor council, a majority of students said that they would be less likely to cheat with an honor code in place than without.]\",\n",

       "  'issue: there is no such thing as purely objective observation. all observation is subjective; it is always guided by the observer\\'s expectations or desires.  this statement actually consists of two related claims: (1) all observation is subjective; and (2) observation is always guided by the observer’s expectations or desires. i strongly agree with the first claim. however, i disagree with the second claim because observation is not always influenced by the observer’s expectations and there are other factors.  i believe that subjective observation can be caused by selection or omission, which are guided by the observer’s personal character. only in some cases, observation is under the control of the observer’s expectations. for example, there is a person who observed his friend to hide something. if his friend had a good reputation, the person might think that his friend had some special reason and did not care it. in contrast, if his friend had a bad reputation, the person might judge that his friend did something bad and would observe more carefully what his friend hide. these examples illustrate that expectation about his friend’s behavior can influence the amount of observation either by promoting or by impeding.  another factor to guide observation is the knowledge of the observer. some years ago, an essay by professor yoo, \"my exploratory reports of cultural assets\", was popular. in his book, he frequently used the phase that you can see as you know. when observing the cultural assets, the more knowledgeable you are about the asset, the more you observe. if people have a chance to observe an old buddhist temple, someone can see only the size of temple, a stone monument in the garden, or a magnificent buddhist statue. however, if you read the book, my exploratory reports of cultural assets, you tried to observe the window frame of each temple. you must be surprised at the diverse and delicate carving and remind the story related each pattern that you read about in his book. in short, this observation is not influenced by observer’s expectation, but by observer’s knowledge.  in addition, the observation is reflected by the sex orientation. for example, if a female is introduced to a group of people, and each person’s observations of the female are noted. men would generally have one or two comments about the subject. however, women’s observation would tend to be more complex and cover details such as hair, lip color, clothing, and shoes.  in summary, all observation is subjective. and, i believe that all observation is not guided by the observer’s wishes. the author overlooks the other factors that influence observation such as knowledge and sex orientation of observer.'),\n",

       "  \"#130. how children are socialized today determines the destiny of society. unfortunately, we have not yet learned how to raise children who can help bring about a better society.    is is probably the elder's job to concern about their children, and about making them adaptable to the society. but in these days of an exceptional change of society, it became even more complicate tasks to socialize the children. i believe that we have to learn more who to raise children as old ideas are of no use now.    as a matter of fact, there was a heyday that we have almost already learned how to educate children. since the generalized education systems have introduced around the society, we have done it pretty well. children have been going to school from early of their lives. at the same time, their parent have been mentors who helped their children being socialized. simply assimilating them with the firmly established thoughts, philosophies, manners of society would possibly do enough. thanks to the society that seemed to stay constant at the same situation as children grew up, children readily became as the society asked with knowledges they learned. it is not because children in the past are much more compliant, but the repertory of the education program was settled and ready to provide every sort of knowledge, a mental education included.    it was true, until the era of rapid change of technology and society opened. since our social levels of spirits could hardly catch up the technological development, now we are a little confused about what to provide children with. it is also about the time at which we suffer from the collapse of education. children prefer to stay in the internet space while surfing around or mix with their cyber friends, rather than read books or go to the museum. they think, talk, laugh with the digital signals and with the speed of signals travel. images are familiar to them, but letters so tedious. it seems reasonable that children refuse to accept the knowledge being taught at school.  not yet. how about an implication for life? maybe they think human can create or even destroy lives without any constraint, like human used to  manage the testtube baby or the clonal sheep, dolly. but what they are learning at school or in the family is something out of time. children will be kicked out to the society as grown up without anything prepared for.    i'm not weigh less on the ready-made education because it plays its own role to maturate the children's thought. but a prevailing education program that gives answers for newly asked questions is necessary. in order to raise the children with matching program, the mental maturity of society must precede. attention on the spiritual sciences, for instance, must be payed as largely as we did on technology. it is because we are lacking of contents to teach. children need to know under what basis of thought can they deal with all those technical tools without being distracted by them. they should know that life is still valuable despite of those researches.    direct education itself is not a unique way to socialize child to a proper existence. all of the manners and customs of society, whenever they are shown, gradually make him into a socially organized existence. even in this point of view, spiritual feature still weighs a lot. if the society drift itself without being at anchor of thoughts, we have difficulties to present valuable properties of society to our children. something should be built up. that is, we are not yet ready to raise our children with tact.    a discord between the older and younger generation have happen at any given time in the history. we even read one of the greek philosopher had complained about the youngers of the time to be impudent, troublesome, etc, as today's elders do. it sounds interesting that maybe it is a common phenomenon, the friction among them, in the course of socializing the youth. but the problem we experience today is something more than that. before learning how to raise our children, first our society should have qualify to be capable of guiding them, by looking for a bit more balance between technology and philosophy.  ---end  hi, i read all of your comment with care... you always emphasized to be concise.. i do agree with it and i am trying to be like that. but what about mixing them together, the short sentence and the lont but logical one? i think the last sentense of the essay above is good enough, and should be that long to convey my point without pause.\"),\n",

       "  \"#95. people work more productively in teams than individually. teamwork requires cooperation, which motivates people much more than an individual competition does.     within a society, people are interacting among them in any given way, for a purpose of personal success or for larger society gains. individual competition is one of the system that thrust people forward by stimulating each other. another system, compare to this, is teamwork that is said it motivates people to work much more productively than individual competition does. but i believe that several conditions must be guaranteed for us to enjoy the benefit of teamwork.    first, generally in teams, each individual differs from inherent ability, even though every member exerts all of their efforts to cooperate together. the problem is that such individual differences will probably harm personal incentives during the team-working, if the compensation is given in lump-sum. for example, in my university course, one lecture assigned students a teamwork project, which achievement would be reflected at the grade. (sorry but mention me what can go for that 'reflect'..) unfortunately the grade was going to be given in the unit of team, as it was hard to measure personal devotions. all of the members of my team promised to do our own best but what we could really work out at that time was far from our expectations. apparently, since our personal abilities could hardly congruent one another, some of us with higher qualifications happened to realize that the grade would not be good enough considering their own abilities. the grade would be given for the average achievement of a team and it would only be welcomed to the rest with relatively low abilities. they even felt sorry that the project did not given for students on individual basis. consequently not all of our members could enjoy the project at the absence of incentives, and they did not do their best. no doubt that this did harm our ultimate achievement. the example shows us that there is a possibility that the cooperation in the beginning of team-working, cannot last for long, as the distinct devotions of constituent are not reflected by the compensations.    second, it must be guaranteed that there exists an adhesive relation among them that will induces voluntary cooperations, or maybe the team possibly experiences the shirking and free-riding problems. we can find an example of the argument in the society of ants. ants are genetically programmed to work as a brick of wall of their kingdom. but we can hardly expect that some spiritual relationship binding them together. it is quite interesting to find that about 20% of ants in a group would shirk their work while other 80% are absorbed in it. what is more, if we take that diligent 80% apart to make another group, still there, we can find another 20% newly shirk their responsibilities! teamworks of human are similar with it. in a company team of different people from different places have no special relationship each other, let alone, say, love. the only thing that bind them together is a common reward, but not enough to prevent them from being shirker or free-rider.    i am sure of that teamwork is more productive that individual competition if those aforementioned problems are solved. because individual competition may grow worse to be a over-competition, or it may even be deteriorated to become a mutual obstruct. teamwork is effective to bring out individual's ability of different color that, gathered together, make a beautiful mosaic.  －end  hi, i am glad that you liked my essay. (yeah~) well, here goes a summary.    it is elder generations' job to raise youngsters to become acceptable to the society. but it is even more complicate to socialize them in these days of exceptionally rapid change. (i think the last 'of' clause is not so meaningless.)    there was a heyday that we almost learned how to educate our children, as society seemed to stay in its situation and the spiritual level of society was firm enough to provide children with various education, especially mental education. but as the era of rapid change of technology and society open, the conventional education system is no longer effective enough. children who are most familiar with cyber space of internet and media wonder why they have to learn all that traditional texts of education. and their perspectives of life ethics is terrible.(what can be replaced in here?) to give answers to them, mental maturity of society must precede. we have to concentrate on spiritual sciences as well as on technology.    mental feature of society is not only important for education system but also crucial for society itself to embody instructive informations, which will be presented to children.(is it clear?) one specific example is an immorality of cyber relationship. social trend seems to allow such lustful chat-and-meet(i don't know how to say in english.), cyber liaisons, etc. children learn much from their teacher and parents, but they can also learn from social trend or atmosphere. they hardly get chance to know what a real meaning of relationship among people is in these days of moral corruption.    as we see above, our society is not ready to be an educator. of course the elder generation have experienced difficulties during raising the youngers. ancient greek philosopher have mentioned about it, too. but nowadays, first, we even confused and drifted at the change of society itself. after anchoring ourselves at the firmly established mental feature of the society, such as ethics, then we can think about socializing our children.  -end. and how about this?  another few questions. people vs peoples... what is the difference? usage?  what's wrong with this sentence? it became even more complicate tasks to socialize children.  .... thanks a lot. see you!\"),\n",

 sure we do because their functions are not the same in this society and one cannot replace another.  i bought a computer system recently.  being lazy to do a product research, i turned to one of my friends who knows so much about computer.  he has broad knowledge in computer systems and computer brand.  he reads many different computer related magazines and looks through computer parts broachers to compare prices whenever possible.  when i asked for an advice, he asked the main purpose of new computer.  immediately after he got his answer, he suggested me a computer brand and the model number of the computer.  i am very happy that i followed his advice.  to achieve the goal of purchasing the best computer for me, i did not need to go to a microprocessor engineer or software developers because i needed a help from a person who has broad knowledge about computer and usage, not a specific field of computer systems.  regarding the story about my visit to a dental office, i went to see a general practitioner because i sought an opinion from an expert who has broad perspectives in dental treatment even though i knew that i would need help from a specialist.  without generalist’s help, i would not know which specialist i had to be treated by.  more often than not, we seek for help from generalists in our daily lives.  we just do not realize it when happens.  the fact that we get more frequent help from generalist does not decrease the necessity of help from specialists nor lessen the importance of their expertise.  we are receiving helps from the specialists indirectly through generalists.  thinking about the car i drive almost everyday, i cannot even imagine how many specialists efforts are melted in it.  the truth is that all the benefits we receive from generalists are mainly from the knowledge and experience provided by specialists.  for example, my daughter’s elementary school teacher who knows about child development, effective teaching methods, mathematics, english, music, and even arts and craft is educated by so many different specialists from each field.  without specialist, there is no generalist.  i read a news article few years ago about the jobless ph.d.s in korea.   while back, there were common understanding among koreans that expertise in a specific area gave a job security and wealth.  this was a good motivation for many students to pursue the highest degree in academia.  this resulted outnumber of specialist in demand of some fields, and many of the specialists had to give up their fields of study to become generalists.  that, however, was a phenomenon many years ago.   nowadays, the number of specialists is about right for the demand of the korean society.  it is because the excessive supply of specialists outnumbered the demand.  but, such a short-term phenomenon was naturally adjusted due to a simple economic rule of thumb: demand and supply.  in the long run, there is no over or underflow of specialists.  if any statistics shows the number of the two groups is unbalanced, it is only a short-term problem because the balance would be maintained by human resource market.    it is inappropriate to say generalists are more important or more needed than specialists.  both specialists and generalists are necessary for our society because they compensate each other.  as long as the ratio between specialists and generalists is concerned, the balance between two groups will be maintained by our socio-economic system unless market is controlled by the government such as some communist countries.  it is incorrect and unnecessary to claim that specialists are overrated for this reason.'),\n",

Also, when the school district of our neighboring town of Rutherford eliminated its music programs two years ago, the overall grade point average in the high school increased by 10 percent the next year. Surely the money spent on Solano music programs could be better used to improve the quality of traditional academic courses.]\",\n",

that is, without using any matches or lighters.  finding some wood and some tinder was quite easy; the whole forest seemed to lend a hand with those.  most of the collected wood was dry and it seemed easy to light a fire.  i happily started rubbing two sticks together, like those countless neanderthal mannequins that i have seen before in museums.  it was thirty minutes before someone noticed my profuse sweating and handed me a flint and a stone.  i learned later that, although my ‘mission impossible’ was not suppose to use any matches or lighters, a flint and a stone were allowed.  i rubbed the stone and the flint with all my might for another thirty minutes until i finally sparked enough sparks to light the tinder.  i carefully blew on my precious lovely little baby fire until it became a rambunctious toddler.  by this time, i had taken off all my clothing except a t-shirt amidst the temperature of minus five celsius degrees and still, i was sweating profusely.  i had overcome my ‘mission impossible’ of lighting a fire while there was already a bonfire (lighted by expert boy scouts using matches) going right next to me.  after our boy scout had roasted marshmallows and had retired to our own tents, i lay awake with my head peaking outside the tent and into the silver spray painted skies above.  the arid sky smelled of winter, one of my favorite seasonal scents.  as i searched for the ursa major and ursa minor, i wondered if those same skies were as clearly visible to the neanderthal man, not the museum mannequins, but real live people who have lived eons before me, as it was to me.  as my mind freely roamed from the skies to the neanderthal man, i wondered how the neanderthal man lighted their fire.  my hardships during the evening with my ‘mission impossible’ made me think that the neanderthal people would have been very glad if i had brought them a lighter.          if i could take a modern invention back in time, i would take lighter with me.  there are many other useful modern innovations that would be helpful to people whom lived in the past.  a 4-wheel drive vehicle would have been very useful to the pioneers who discovered the adventurous new western frontier in north america.  instead of using wagons or horses, with the use of a 4-wheel drive vehicle, pioneers would have traveled much faster and safer in the wilderness.  a light bulb would have been a great idea for people before the time of thomas edison.  a light bulb is much brighter and would also make life more convenient and safer compared to candlelight.  possibly a computer might fascinate the people of the past.  its seemingly magical ability to visually show objects on its screen and its ability to input data as the user wishes to would have been an unimaginable invention for people only a century ago.  however, all these inventions would be of no use if they had been invented before their births.  during the pioneering period for northern america, there was no use of natural oil or oil refineries.  a 4-wheel drive vehicle would be of no use without gas.  a light bulb would also be of no use if there were no electricity.  without electricity, a light bulb cannot illuminate one tiny inch even in the darkest part of the universe.  similarly, without electricity, a computer cannot operate, let alone turn on its monitor.  however, a lighter does not need other modern inventions to operate correctly.  it is a simple mechanism of a flint, piece of metal, and some gas.  it is safe and easy to handle and can operate for a long time, much longer than a 4-wheel drive or a laptop.         if time travel were possible, i would go back to the time when the neanderthal man lived.  it would probably be the time period when a lighter would be most appreciated.  the discovery of fire has lead to mankind’s superiority.  fire has lead to the development of civilization and to the technology and comfort we have today.  if i could give the neanderthal men the power to control and use fire, i would be fast-forwarding the history of humans by a few thousand years.  and i would be able to grant this power with a simple, easy to use tool.  before, the neanderthal men would have had to rub sticks or rub flint stones together to generate small insignificant sparks.  i understand how frustrating this can be because of my experience with my mission at the lutsen mountains.  by giving mankind a jump-start on the development of technology, faster development and better technology will exist in the society we live in now.          although traveling back eons of time just to give a lighter to a real live neanderthal man might seem insignificant; its difference will be impeccable.  while a more technological device may seem more exquisite and utilizable, most of those devices cannot work without the energy that contemporary society provides now.  those inventions were made according to the time era of its birth.  however, a lighter provides fire, which was a necessity for human beings since the dawn of civilization.  it is simple, yet it has the capacity to bring out what human beings have eventually based their whole society on.  i would like to take this lighter, a paradoxical invention that can be so sophisticated yet so simple, to the neanderthal men and advance our society even more.'),\n",

taking that big first step toward overcoming my challenge, i was able to take a glimpse at the satisfaction of giving efforts and overcoming a challenge in the field of medicine.  when i tutored young

was very bright and ambitious.  i tried my best to make him do his math homework, but he just did not see why he had to study math.  it was quite a challenge to make someone change his way of thinking much less change his life.  hoping to teach him how he lacks abilities to reason and think logically, i decided to give him a brain teaser that he could not solve instead of a math question, which he found tedious.  he seemed bothered at first and from then on always asked me for brain teaser questions.  after a few weeks, he solved one of my brain teaser questions, and i could definitely see that he was very satisfied with his level of thinking.  fortunately, he began to like math afterwards, and i was able to understand the power of changing a person뭩 state of mind.    being a doctor, not only does it give me a chance to try to save someone, but it also gives me an opportunity to approach and work to change a patient뭩 mentality, much like i did for my student.  no physician can make a dying patient live another decade or restore people뭩 health from incurable diseases.  but, they can certainly alleviate patients?pain and make it more comfortable to sit in a hospital.  obviously, it

       "  \"this argument concludes that author's company should contruct with appian roadways rather than mcadam road builders to construct the access roads for all their new shopping malls. the argument is not logically convincing because it is based on questionable assimtpions.  first of all, the argument assumes that what happened in a section of route <NUM> will happen in a section of route 66. however, there could be a different possible outcome. if the author wants to justify the questionable assumptions he must demonstrate those two sections have the same environments and conditions such as the using rate, natural geographical features, weather condition, etc. for instance, a section of route <NUM> could be passed by heavy traffic, while a section of  route <NUM> could not. accordingly, the surface of a section of route <NUM> would be more damaged to traffic than a section of route 66, so it is natural to differ from condition of the two roadways. if this assumption is not to be trusted, then perhaps the author's memo is not so convincing.  secondly, the author makes the assumption that mcadam road builders(mrb) and appiam roadways(ar) are similar. are they really similar in many sides? maybe not, and this is a bad analogy. for example, it is possible that ar would be paid considerable money. on the other hands, ar could be completed a section of route <NUM> to spend greatly more working hours than mrb was completed a section of route 101. according to degree of supports or working hours, the quality of construction could be difference. therefore, there could be no comparison between ar and mrb without indicating futher information.   finally, the argument relies on the assumption that ar will ensure its superior work and commitment to quality. but perhaps there might have been alternate explanations for the outcome of construction. for instance, ar could be lead to confusion because it has hired a new quality-control manager. it is possible that the new manager often collides with worker of long standing. hence, ar could not well-construct to than authour's expectation. if this casual assumption is not true, and finally the conclusion would be untrue.  in conclusion, the author claim his oppinion in a memo that his company should contract whit ar for constructing the access roads for all their new shopping malls. to be more convincing, it should provide evidence that there are some sides of similarity in conditions in a section of route <NUM> and route <NUM> and between ar and mrb, and it should be more specific explanation or example about ar's constructional skills.\"),\n",

       "  \"many people in the world have some experience playing dangerous sports. many more dream of doing one. but as many recordings show, dangerous sports are in fact dangerous, and an accident that happens while performing can be fatal. if it is so, then why do these people enjoy the game? are they all mad? obviously, only a few of them are out of their minds. then why do extreme sports flourish? this can be explained by two reasons: hormones and admiration.  increase in hormones, which can be seen during a performance, makes people become addicted to extreme sports. humans are slaves of hormones, and playing dangerous sports produces a large amount of adrenaline, a hormone that can be seen when someone's feeling extreme fear and pain. for instance, when people skate on an edge of a tall box, their brain senses so much danger that it feels stress and emits signals for adrenaline. adrenalin creates a sort of 'dreamish' feeling, and that's why people get thrilled by these sports. that's why men get addicted to these games.  also, since the sports are dangerous and therefore cannot be played by unskilled individuals, those who can do it are admired by those who can't. human beings have many ambitions, and one of those dreams is becoming someone different. one way to achieve this is to play extreme games. being able to play extreme sports means that the person is different from normal people. this leads one to become an idol for others, and to become a symbol for others to follow.  in short, the two reasons why people play dangerous sports are: first, because amount of adrenalin in one's blood increases, generating a dreamy feeling. second, because one receives admiration from others. for those who play it, extreme sports are ways of nourishing what they need, and thus we can see that extreme sports will take an important part in the future of humanity.\"),\n",

       "  'for long time, books have existed for people who have searched for information, knowledge, and even education. these days, mass media have replaced it, especially radio and television as well as internet. however, books have their own values for several reasons. this is that the books have unique characteristics compared with television. television communicate with viewers in one-direction way; that is, television send its program to viewers without consideration, caution, and warnings. on the other hand, books are chosen by readers who can pick up their books properly. in spite of the fact that most thing has both sides, taking all that into consideration, books lie in significant position in our life.   of the reasons to support my position, what i want to stress is that as we choose books, we already have our purpose such as for education, for filling backgrounds, and for a sense of emotion. in contrast, when the television was broadcasted, most viewers largely have no sense of purpose, and they unconsciously pay attention to programs which are not really connected to their needs and purpose. even they watched programs with their children without selection. this, from time to time, causes juvenile problems because our children easily accept and respond television. for instance, advertisement leads them to follow someone who is squander, so their parents get in trouble in solving their undiscerning spending. thus some parents controlled their watching time and recommend reading books. the reason is that books give them only beneficial aspects and time to think of whether its information is useful or harmful.   the other reason is that book is one of the mutual communications. that means that the author exhibited their thought, aspects, and opinions for the events, and then the readers respond the author’s thought, aspects, and opinions with careful consideration. it points out the difference between books and television. in addition, generally television only showed limited area of full scene. it leaded to false conclusion. for example, television showed the opinion of the events which is spoken by experts. the scene of showing experts to say about the events sometimes cut off someone. so this guided our viewers to reach inaccurate judgment. books, as opposed the television, have leaved time and space of thinking as well as have given us full scenery.   eventually, the books are more beneficial than television in some way or others. even though some advocate television’s benefits, for above-mentioned reasons, i am side of supporting reading books’preference. last but not least, books still exist for our demands, and if we adequately use them, our shortage in knowledge and other areas would be fulled.'),\n",

Second, robots do not make mistakes, so factories would increase their output. Finally, the use of robots would also improve the morale of factory workers, since factory work can be so boring that many workers would be glad to shift to more interesting kinds of tasks.]',\n",

Groveton's honor code replaced an old-fashioned system in which students were closely monitored by teachers and an average of thirty cases of cheating per year were reported. The honor code has proven far more successful: in the first year it was in place, students reported twenty-one cases of cheating; five years later, this figure had dropped to fourteen. Moreover, in a recent survey conducted by the Groveton honor council, a majority of students said that they would be less likely to cheat with an honor code in place than without.\",\n",

Groveton\\'s honor code replaced an old-fashioned system in which students were closely monitored by teachers and an average of thirty cases of cheating per year were reported. The honor code has proven far more successful: in the first year it was in place, students reported twenty-one cases of cheating; five years later, this figure had dropped to fourteen. Moreover, in a recent survey conducted by the Groveton honor council, a majority of students said that they would be less likely to cheat with an honor code in place than without.\"',\n",
       "  \"this argument concludes that due to dramatic rise in cheating among college and university students, these institutions should adopt honor codes similar to groveton's. but this argument is based on some questionable assumptions and is not logically convincing as it stands.  firstly, the author assumes that honor codes bring about the student to quit cheating in their academic endeavors. but, it is possible that it is due to the alternate explanation like the students who entered after honor code inducted are more ethical student than ever before. thus, to make this argument more persuasive, the author should rule out the alternate explanations like what mentioned above.  additionally, the author compared the cheating per year between tocombat and groveton to convince that honor grade is successful. since there is no evidence that amounts of students in tocombat and groveton are equal, mere comparison of the number of cheating students is meaningless. although five years passed since the first year when honor code is executed, the argument also compares the cheating per year between the first year and fire years later. decrease of <NUM> cases to <NUM> cases would be just due to the decrease of total students within five years. without providing accurate cheating rate of each case, the argument is still doubtable.  finally, the recent survey is conducted to students has a problem. although the cheating is still done among students, they may respond to the survey that they don't cheat in their academic endeavors and are less likely to do with an honor code. this is because they still tend to get good grade within comfort manner, and if the honor code is not effective, the faculty members would make another method to prevent cheating. therefore the recent survey of students is not good evidence to convince the author's claim.  in conclusion, the argument suggest that college and university should adopt honor codes similar to groveton's. to be more persuasive, it should provide so appropriate evidences that the readers can understand it effectively.\"),\n",

       "  'both the artist and the critic play important roles in establishing and developing society’s cultural and aesthetic heritage. where there is an artist, there will be a critic who appreciates the artist’s work from critical point of view and suggests in depth analysis and evaluation on it. but the one who gives perpetual influence on society is the artist, not the critic. the critic exists mainly to help ordinary people fully understand the artist’s works and excavate hidden meanings or values in them. the value of the artistic works transcends time and space because its characteristics such as creativity and aesthetic beauty are things that appeal to mankind as a whole. when we listen to classic music of the romantic period, we enjoy and admire it in not so much different way as its contemporary people. when we read the novels by charles dickens, we hold breaths and feel kinds of catharsis exactly where his contemporaries did, even if how we feels about it can be different in details.  what distinguishes products of artists from those of critics is the existence of creativity and transcendence. first, criticisms essentially based on the artists’ work just analyze and interpret it, lacking artistic creativity. as analysis and interpretation from various points of view are possible, there can be numerous criticisms on one artistic works. they can guide ordinary people in appreciating the work, but usually do not last forever with the artist’s work. second, the criticism produced by critics is subject to the backgrounds from which it came. critics have their own values and philosophical stands reflecting the value system and situation of the society where they live. therefore, their criticisms on the artworks cannot be free from all environmental and historical circumstances. it often happens that criticisms made later subvert former criticisms. for example, harold bloom, a great literature critic, wrote a lot of excellent pieces of criticism on english novels and poetry, which were at that time considered unquestionable and even classical. but nowadays many critics present quite different and widely accepted views, annulling large part of his power as a great critic. in sum, though we cannot overlook the roles played by the critics in giving feedback to and re-evaluating the artists’ works, criticisms, be refined and insightful, have only transient influences on the society, while the artist can create ever-lasting pieces of art which bear universal and diachronic values.'),\n",

       "  'in the statement above, the dean at buckingham college argues that the college should build a new dormitory to meet the housing needs of students. the grounds on which this proposal is based on are as follows: (1) the college’s enrollment is growing currently and should double over the next fifty years; (2) the average rent for an apartment around the college has increased recent years, imposing heavier burden on students; (3) a newly-built dormitory would attract prospective students to the college. it may seem a reasonable and feasible argument at a first glance, but the evidence is neither appropriate nor sufficient to support the conclusion. the assumption is that since currently the number of students who enroll the college is increasing it will increase steadily for the next fifty years by 100%. there is no clear evidence that current trends of increasing students will continue for as many as fifty years in the future. it can be just temporary phenomenon. maybe recent advertisement for the college could be successful in attracting students or colleges in competitive relationship with buckingham college would have some problems with students, result in directing prospective students to buckingham college. then the effect will not last for long and, often, this is the case. secondly, the dean points out that a new dormitory would save students who are under pressure of the apartment rent rising recently. but, there is no indication that capacity of the current dormitory cannot hold the entire students, with many of them left off-campus. if few students live in the town and are affected by rise of the apartment rent, a new dormitory would be virtually of no use. even if there are considerably many students living off-campus, a closer research on recent trends of apartment rent should be performed before building a new dormitory. the ‘average’ rent for an apartment is too general information to conclude the rent students are paying is actually rising. the rent for upmarket apartments where college students are unlikely to live can have been on the steep rise recently, contributing to the rise of the ‘average’ rent. more detailed statistics on the rent for apartments of different levels is necessary. finally, the indication that a new dorm would attract prospective students to the college misses other more important and influential factors that appeal to prospective students. prospective students are likely to weigh other factors more significantly such as faculty constitution, scholarship programs for students, social status and reputation of the college and so forth. when the college invests little in those things, prospectively are likely to think that buckingham college is not a very attractive choice, despite a new dormitory. the dean of the college argues that a new dormitory will not only benefit their students by supplying more rooms, but help increase the college’s enrollment. but the conclusion is made hastily, based on the evidence which is not sufficient and specific enough. to support the argument more firmly, thorough research on trends of the increase of students, detailed statistics about the apartment rent, and consideration of other factors which affect prospective student’s choice of college will be needed.'),\n",

       "  \"this recommendation is that forley college promises to find its students jobs and by that  competes against larger and more prestigious schools. the dean at forley college suggests the promise of finding jobs is a strategy to increase enrollment in the situation that many students are concerned about job prospects after graduation. yes. generally job prospects may be  the most important  element  to college students, so promising jobs can be the best strategy. in fact, when tthe students choose the college, they tend to evaluate the college by the results of getting a job.       but this recommendation does not show how to find students job. promising doesn't give the job practically. so the promise that has a concrete proposal should be guaranteed. for example, the recommendation a student who acquires some units to a particular company, the opening of curriculum for acquirnment  a qualification or the presentation of figures that students have jobs after graduation can be a good material to impress the pre-students.      on the other hand, even though job finding is the most important thing, there are other many elements for student to choose a college.  for example, the contents of a course and the faculty are also very important elements for choosing a college. so the contents of a course and the faculty as much as job finding should be proposed.      and if the students prepare for careers as soon as they enter college, the level of the college can fall to the post of the institute for certification. that means the special characteristic of a college, the persue of scholarship, is disappeared.      for the students who are not concerned about job prospects after graduation, the various promises should be proposed.\"),\n",

       "  'art is one of factors that enrich society by providing artists’ works and subsequent related activities such as art criticism by critics and art appreciation by viewers. though this whole activities in a sphere of art start from artists creating artistic works, critics are also necessary in that they provide a given society with aesthetically discerning insight in artistic assessment and inform people in appreciation.  of course, it seems that they are no ones but artists who show productivity in artistic sphere. above all, artists do make pieces of work. even in criticism, critics need some pieces of work to evaluate. there were several periods in history, such as germany in world war ii, when there were no newly made artistic works but only a bunch of criticism about works of the former period. it was because artists were afraid to make something which motivation might oppose to an ideology of country so be harshly disapproved by certain critics. as a result, field of art of such society looked like nothing but an arena of criticism.  however, criticism in art is essential process in that criticism gives a work of art  credible value. without critics, we easily ignore a great work of art, or even praise an aesthetically worthless one. several works of vincent van gogh is a striking example. when gogh was alive, his pieces of work were regarded as of no artistic value. even for some period after his death, his works were thrown into obscurity. but thanks to a sincere effort of several critics, works of van gogh, such as ‘crows in the field’ were appreciated as great works of human history. it is only when critics make discerning judgment on artistic products, that society enjoys, with confidence, pieces of art of real lasting value.  critics not only make a valuable judgment on works of art, but also provide some useful guidance for common people most of whom have no discerning aesthetic viewpoints. to the extent that an artistic product accepted to as many as people in a given time can be regarded as a valuable one, society necessitates such guidance from critics. all varieties of opinion as a sum, offered by critics, are served as useful information to viewers who attempt to appreciate certain works of art. this is because, for instance, we read some books or texts of criticism before heading for an art gallery or while listening to classical music.  to sum it all up, artists and critics are not compromising entities but rather complimentary two. while artists create artistic pieces, critics discerningly assess those works as an ensuing activity. also critics are knowledgeable enough to inform common people who attempt to enjoy works of art.'),\n",

       "  \"the statement above points out some negative aspects of the greatest social, political, and individual achievements that are found in history though, what it alleges is specious as it overlooks the whole picture of the matter.  admittedly, some greatest historical achievements are not likely to satisfy people at the time. one of the greatest achievements of our economic system is capitalism. but capitalism seems to have resulted in discontent of people in terms of distribution of wealth. because capitalism has emphasized private wealth, competition and development, so called, enlarging the pie, the issue of distribution, that is splitting the pie, has been dealt with a less importance. this has subsequently brought about unbalance of wealth distribution in a given country(intra-country) or around the world(inter-country).the relative poor in a country may have definite discontent as they compare their quality of life with that of the rich. people of under-developed countries around the world, such as africans, are suffering from poverty, while people of advanced nations are, ironically, suffering from diabetes and obesity. therefore it seems that capitalism have brought about great discontent among many people on the globe.  however, it is also capitalism that enables world's economic growth or one country's economic development, both as a whole. history has been proved that other economic system is less efficient and productive than capitalism. failure of socialism, or communism, as a counterpart of capitalism, is an illustrative example. different from what communists had promised, many countries of the communist bloc faced the economic depressions and thus caused dissatisfaction of people of those countries. this means, if it were not for capitalism, we could not have achieved even the minimum quality of life for which such people of communism gasped. though capitalism have caused inequality of wealth in part, there is no doubt that it has driven the world's entire economy to a certain success.  nuclear energy is an even more striking example. when nuclear reactor was first invented in a laboratory of u.s. military, it was aimed to construct weapons of mass destruction, the nuclear bomb, afterward, practically used during world war ii. though ‘the theory of relativity’, which theoretically backed up the nuclear reaction, was indeed a scientific eclat as well as a greatest individual achievement of albert einstein, its usage ultimately caused such great agony among people. hard to deny that the individual achievement is served as great discontent.  on the contrary, what has solved serious global energy crises is also that nuclear reactor reformed as a nuclear power plant. nuclear power plants are used in many countries instead of rather inefficient fossil fuel power plants. considering that electric energy is pivotal in people’s daily lives, the achievement of doctor einstein is bliss to people around the world. and these benefits, as a sum, are not less than the pain caused by military usage. maybe the blame of discontent is rather on the users of the marvelous technology, not the technology itself.  as seen above, the historically greatest achievements are mostly beneficent as considered through broader viewpoints. the specific examples of capitalism and nuclear energy tell much about this fact. if the rightful application of such greatest achievements has ever been guaranteed, those achievements have been always bliss rather than curse.   @@ question! @@ this time i managed to write an essay which each paragraph begins directly with introducing examples. this was partly due to the characteristic of the topic. what do you think about this try( that is, to spend a paragraph solely for examplifying)?\"),\n",

       "  'there are many students who come from other countries to the united states of america. they usually goes to public schools and get knowledge and experience there. in this process, they need special types of assistance because they are non-english speaking students. they need a help at public schools. here, i will explain some type of assistance which non-english speaking students need.   first, non-english speaking students need communicators at public schools where they start to study. communicators can be teachers, school staffs and other stuents(buddies). non-english speaking students are afraid of housing, learing, getting relations with others in new country because they have language problem. even if they have an intermediate english language skill, they need a kind helper who is willing to help them to live without worries.    second, non-english speaking students need special english courses. some students are rich enough to get additional english lessons with their means, but others are not. so public schools should give non-english speaking students special english courses. english is the base for them to live in the united states of america.    third, public schools try to help non-english speaking students in finance. non-english speaking students spend a lot of money in housing, learning private lessons, air fares and so on. so they need financial aid at schools. public schools try to give non-english speakling students scholarships if students are deserved to get. otherwise, public schools try to give them english lessons for free. schools can use their volunteers.    in conclusion, non-english speaking students need a lot of help at public schools. in the future, they grow as valuable workers for the united states of america. therefore, public schools try to help and invest them properly.'),\n",
       " ('Neighbors are the people who live near us. In your opinion, what are the qualities of a good neighbors? Use specific details and examples in your answer.',\n",
       "  \"although our society is modernized and people get individualized, a human, as a social creature, should always live with others such as friends, familly members and neighbors. therefore, to be a good neighbor is necessary not only for the altruistic purpose but for the clever strategy to live with others. in my opinion, the most important qualities of a good neighbor are etiquette to take care others and willingness to help each other.      first, the most important character of a good neighbor is etiquette to avoid bothering others in spite of him / her own slight inconvenience. suppose that your neighbor raises a dog. if it bites your children, barks at night or piss in the elevator while the master does not pay attention to the dog's behavior, you may got angry to her. if it repeats the fault again and again, you may conflict with your neighbor. the dog is under the control of your neighbor's and he or she should be careful of the behavior of her dog when it goes out of home even tough it is somewhat troublesome to her.      second, to help the neighbors who are in trouble is as important as not to bother neighbors. hunans cannot live without others' helps and cooperations. to help neighbors, you don't have to be a hero. for examples, to hold a door or elevator for someone with a large bag or to lend drivers for your neighbors to fix their chaors will make them thankful to you. they may try to return your kindness by offering other aids to you. these mutual helps will make your town a pleasure place to live in.       in conclusion, to be a good neighbor, we should try to take care others' convenience and help each other. only when you are a good neighbor can you meet good neighbors.\"),\n",
       " ('ISSUE #147 : Tradition and modernization are incompatible. One must choose between them.',\n",
       "  \"the statement suggests that tradition and modernization are not compatible, so we have to make a decision between them. though both of them differ in nature, tradition and modernization, however, can be combined together as complementary, and we indeed see many of examples in daily lives.  admittedly, tradition and modernization have apparently different characteristics. while tradition pursues spirit, such as preservation, modernization emphasizes change, development, expediency, and so forth. incompatibility between both of them, due to such differences, is easily found in several examples. in a development project of a city, there are much discord between traditionalist and modernist. traditionalist protest against destructing traditional buildings or places which are historically meaningful. on the contrary, modernist want to replace them with modernized buildings or facilities. such disagreement during development project shows how difficult it is to achieve any consensus between tradition and modernization.  however, tradition can serve as to pace down the exceeding speed of today's modernization. modernization somehow misses several important factors when it emphasizes merely on development and expediency. to illustrate, today we are reluctant to spend our time with families, relatives because what modernization implies is to propel ourselves to further achievement on works. but because we are still maintaining our tradition of holyday, such as thanksgiving or christmas, we anyhow make some time to share with families or relatives. in this manner, tradition can also be worthwhile in modernization.  moreover, combination of advantageous factors of both tradition and modernization creates an attractive product. in academics, for example, traditional way of study and modernized way of study are combined each other to be a powerful tool of study. especially in economics, two representative pillars of the field are theories and empirical works, that is, traditional studies and modernized works, respectively. theories provide a blue print to empirical works in the process of statistical analyses. on the contrary, empirical works provide practical evidence of theories. therefore, when tradition and modernization are meshed each other, we obtain a powerful and useful product.  to sum it all up, maybe because tradition and modernization differs in their nature, they can, in turn, serve as complementary for each other, not compromising ones. further, the combination of both, as we seen above, results in an advantageous product for society.\"),\n",
       " ('Issue: \"Both parents and communities must be involved in the local schools. Education is too important to leave solely to a group of professional educators.\"',\n",
       "  'parents and communities should not be involved in the local schools. needless to say, education is important. however, if parents and communities are involved in the local schools, the specialty of professional educators would be interfered.   in my observation, parents usually cannot judge their own children as they are and even overestimate them. as the saying goes: \"the crow thinks her own birds fairest.\" for example, when i took the first driving test, my father thought that i would get a driving licence at once. unfortunately, i wasn\\'t good at driving a car so that i had to take the test three times more. he was somewhat upset about this. despite the parents\\' inaccurate evaluation, parents are so concerned about their children that they want to affect on the education in school. they claim sometimes to teach beyond children\\'s capacities. i know a child of excellent intelligence, but insufficient to regarding as a gifted child or genius. his parents want to send him at the school of special education. however, that school didn\\'t suit for him, and he failed to adapt and lost his interest in study. as this example shows, parents\\' misjudgement can lead their children to the wrong way.   on the other hand, professional educators like teachers are the specialists in education. they know how to teach children better; they know how to evaluate children\\'s abilities correctly, and know the best materials and methods to teach children. because they have studied and experienced about these for a long time, they can evaluate children with their knowledge and without the interests of parents. teachers are the specialists about teaching children just as doctors are the specialists about disease. therefore, professional educators should take charge of education independently, both parents and communities, who are non-specialists, should not be included in the local schools.   in sum, both parents and communities should not be included in the local schools -  especially parents. parental affection and interest in children make parents lose their judgement. therefore, if parents take the charge of education in school, they would not able to evaluate children correctly. only the specialists have to take charge of education. otherwise, a long term plan or consistency of education can be interrupted.'),\n",
       " ('It has been said, \"Not everything that is learned is contained in books.\" Compare and contrast knowledge gained from experience with knowledge gained from books. In your opinion, which source is more important? Why?',\n",
       "  \"there are several ways to gain knowledge in life. people are able to gain knowledge as they read books or have actual experiences. in my opinion, i prefer books rather than experience. here, i will compare an contrast knowledge gained from experience with knowledge gained from books, and explain the reason why books are better than experience when people want to gain knowledge.     first of all, knowledge gained from experience with other people can have a profound impact on our growth as a person. for example, we usually listen to parents' lessons on life which are backed by real life experience. and we usually learn about values, culture and society from discussion with other people. these kinds of knowledge give us wisdom from real life experience.   one more advantage is that we can correct mistakes from real life experience. for example, we can avoid making the same errors as we learn from past mistakes. furthermore, we can expect future obstacles through past errors and prepare to overcome the future obstacles.     while life lessons can provide a great deal of knowledge as i mentioned above, books are sometimes more valuable, books build proper reading and writing skills. through these skills, we can read a large amount of books and gain knowledge during the short period. one more advantage is that books improve creative and innovative skills. we can get a sprit of imagination from books through contents contained what we cannot experience. we can experience the ancient times or the ice ages in books.     books can give us extensive knowledge when we access to an unlimited amount of resources. knowledge from experience is only limited because people cannot experience everything, but we can gain every knowledge from unlimited amount of books. in reality, books can contain everything, but not everything is contained in experience.\"),\n",

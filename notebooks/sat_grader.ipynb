He went to the same extra-school as me and we were waiting for the coach to pick us up. I was waiting patiently, but the boy seemed to have got bored, so he told me we should go to the school by foot. I wasn't sure, so I asked him if he knew the way, and he said yes, so I followed him. The bus was late, something could have happened to it, and I was so young, what else was I to do? We went over the fence cross the road and at one point, the boy said I'll go back to the kindergarten, you stay here or go the the school. I said I don't know the way, I'm going to follow you, and then he said he will go to the school, I should go to the kindergarten, that kept going on. He finally made me cry, and few minutes later, luckly, the kindergarten bus came. It must have been around a students house. I ran over to it, and the boy slowly walked towards it as if he felt bad.

Governments are trying to restrict smoking and I think it is a good idea. I think cigarettes should be made illegal because of two main things. \\r\\n     Firstly, smoking should be illegal because it has negative effects to the smoker and the other people around them. Smoking can cause cancers and other harmful effects to the smoker. Some smokers say that it is ok because his or her health is their own problem, but the real problem is that smoking affects others around them. This can cause other problems like invading others right to be healthy. \\r\\n    Secondly, cigarettes are more addictive then marijana. Why isn`t a much more addictive substance than marijana being made illegal? Smokers near me always say they think they should quit smoking for their own health. They know why they should quit and how serious it is, but because of the addictiveness of cigarettes, they cannot quit. I believe almost every smoker is going the same problem and this should be solved by a forceful law action for the good of everyone.\\r\\n   Finally, cigarettes should be banned for the earth. Smoking causes smoke which is harmful to the nature and after smoking there is always wastes left and most smokers just throw then on the ground. This will make the earth dirty and the odor of smoking will have a harmful effects on plants and other animals. I have read researches that thousands of bad substances are in cigarettes. This shouldn't just harm our nature where we are living.\\r\\n     In conclusion, cigarettes should be made illegal because of the harmful effects to the cigarettes to human and the nature we live in. If we make cigarettes illegal the nature will be more clean and many people will come out of suffering and will make a better world.\",\n",

Influenced by the media, crimes using guns are increasing. To prevent this there should be an age limit for owning guns and even make more restriction laws.\\r\\n     Why should there be an age limit? First of all, children and adolescents do not yet have the mind to determine what they should do and should not do. Their conscience is yet developing and their mind are not stable enough to control. Also teenagers can impulsively commit crime, which can ruin their lives. For example, the Columbine High school tragedy was a result caused by loose gun owning restriction.\\r\\n    Secondly, teenagers and children do not know how precious lives are. They do not know how it will impact their lives if one of their family member or friends die. This cannot be learned at once. This is achieved by experiences with living among others. The value of life is priceless and teenagers and children have to learn and feel how important life is. \\r\\n     In conclusion, to prevent tragedy there should be age limits when owning guns. Adolescents are not mature enough to control themselves. Only time can teach then how precious life is. This is why I think there should be an age limit on owning guns.',\n",

Doing sports would make it much healthier, and you will never get fatter again unless you stop doing the sport. Still, there is more chance that doing sports becomes your habit. You don’t do sports and refuse food instead since it’s hard for you to do sports you don’t usually do so suddenly. And, at the same time, you want to get rid of your fat as quickly as possible. If you are doing it for your looks, you should be choosing to do some healthy sports, especially if you aren’t living with someone else, because you can faint out of vitamin, and it’s dangerous when nobody knows about it.  If you are so fat that you are near danger and death even, some seriouse actions should be taken even if it's not healthy for you, you can't help that. Some people with certain jobs, such as talents, etc. do need fit body, but it wouldn't be needed to harm your body for that.

       " (\"My aunt had a stroke 3 years ago. This led the doctor to diagnose her as a terminally ill patient. She couldn't talk or move very well. She was suffering so much from it. Whenever I visited her and saw her suffering, I felt really sorry for her. Once, she told my mom she would rather die right now than go through the pain. She died 4 months ago suffering until the very end of her life. I don't think she deserved any of the pain. She was a loving and caring aunt for me. She had an illness that couldn't be cured. What was the need for making her go though so much pain?\\r\\n     I strongly believe that the terminally illness patients should have the right to control their own death. First of all, people have the right to control themselves and death can be included. Also, not only does the illness agonize the patients, but also make people around them suffer. For example, they have to see a person they love so much dying with pain and some of them have to pay for the hospital service. Lastly, torturing and beating people are against the law. Then, why is relieving pain from terminally ill people against the law? It simply doesn't make sense to me.\\r\\n     We are now living in the world of freedom. We control almost everything about ourselves, why not a death if you are extremely sick without any hope? Many people don't approve of euthanasia because they think of it as a manslaughter. However, it's different from it. Manslaughter is commited when victim doesn't want to die. Most people don't realize how much pain terminally illl people go through because they have never been in that position. I cried so hard the day my aunt passed away as I remembered how sick she had been. She had a tough life raising four children, why does the ending have do be harsh as well?\\r\\n     Our family went through bitterness when my aunt was dying. Too expensive hospital fee became a burden and our schedules had to evolve around her. Most of all, we couldn't bear watching her wishing to die when we weren't able to make her last wish come true. My mom cried almost everyday. If we had been able to help her die peacefully, the guilt would have been less. \\r\\n     Lastly, I believe dying with pain has the same effect as torturing or beating people, if not more. When you think about it, the illness is torturing the patient until he or she dies. What can stop the torturing? With nowadays' technology, only the death can. Thus, the euthanasia should be permitted. \\r\\n    Without any doubt, I approve of the euthanasia. It lift off the burden from both the patients and people around them. Let terminally ill people at least die without any pain.\",\n",

       " ('When I went to Las Vegas about a year ago, I could actually see the huge impact of legalized gambling on the community. Almost every street was crowded with people and we had a traffic jam. Also, the hotel booked up so quickly we had a hard time finding a room, despite the fact that there are more than 20 hotels in Las Vegas! There are so many restaurants that our family could go to a different restaurant for every single meal. The community of the Las Vegas was surly different from other communities I have been to.  \\r\\n      If the gambling is legalized, it would affect the community in many different ways, both in social and economic aspects. First of all, the crime rate would shoot up as foreigners increase. A small and tight community would turn into a busy and indifferent community as many people move in and out of it. Because of many travelers coming to gamble, it would benefit economically as they spend their money on lodging, restaurants, and, the most importantly, gambling. However, because people living in the community can easily consume their money on gambling, there can be a loss as well.\\r\\n     In the social aspect, the gambling would affect the crime rate, traffic, and the relationship between people in the community. The crime rate is prone to increase if the gambling is legalized. More gambling means more drinking and  fights. There would be more traffic problem as well. Many cars accommodating gamblers and trucks transporting things needed to run casinos, restaurants and hotels are the main cause of it. Neighbors would become unconcerned about other neighbors because so many people will move in and out of the community.  \\r\\n     Economically, the community would profit from the gamblers gathering in it. Some of them would spend enormous amount of money. It is a human’s nature to want to earn a lot of things with a small amount, the money isn’t the exception. This human nature triggers the gambler to spend more and more on the gambling. The community would economically improve with new buildings and facilities built in. Las Vegas was more developed than any other communities surrounding it. It was very surprising to find that Las Vegas developed in the middle of the desert like that. I think the legalized gambling made it possible.\\r\\n     Legalizing gambling can affect the community hugely. Therefore, before legalizing it, there needs to be enough consideration and discussion regarding it.',\n",

A boy I saw in earth science class waved so I sat down next to him. He had gray hair and blue eyes. He was really tall, maybe the tallest guy among all of my friends. He looked at me curiously and asked, “Where are you from?” I told him that I was from Korea. Then he asked another question that completely threw me off. “Do they have orange juice in Korea?” That was how Darrick and I first met each other. He and I had four classes together. As time passed, we became best friends.\\r\\n     He had great curiosity and was witty. While we were chatting on AOL Instant Messenger (AIM), he asked me if there is a chatting system in Korea as well. “Buddy Buddy Instant Messenger,” which was very similar to AIM, was very popular in Korea at that time. He managed with difficulty to download it and asked me if he can acquire a screen name as well. Apparently, he couldn’t because he didn’t have an access to type Korean. Since he was so eager to see how Korean chatting system works, I decided to let him use my screen name and password.\\r\\nThe next day, Darrick, still looking confused, said, “Yesterday was hectic! When I logged on to your screen name, so many messages were coming so fast. It scared me. What made the matter worse was that I didn’t understand any of what your friends were talking about. The only symbol I understood was a question mark!” This made me laugh so hard. My Korean friends wanted to know why I sent the same message in English over and over when I got on-line a few days later. I asked them what the message had said and they told me it just had had one word, hi. He is the funniest friend I had ever had. \\r\\n     Darrick and I were both stage crew members. After so many rehearsals, the moment we had waited for so long came. There were so many audiences that it made me nervous despite the fact I didn’t have any main part. The light went off after act 1 so stage crew members started moving and carrying settings when it happened. There was a crashing sound and loud noise. As I looked around, I saw Darrick lying on the floor. It was obvious that he had fallen down with the floor lamp. Audience was startled and stage crew members were all embarrassed. However, now that more than 5 moths had passed after it happened, whenever I look back to that time, I find it hard to stop smiling. \\r\\n     Darrick would often laugh in his strange way, ask weird questions and make funny comments. Meeting Darrick in Hamilton was the most humorous experience I had ever had. The fact that he is now in the United States and I am back in Korea wouldn’t be a barrier between our friendships but I must say that I miss him so much. I am glad that I have such an amazing friend.',\n",

There are many important qualities of a roommate but I think concideration, polite, and responsible are the most need qualities of a roommate.\\r\\n   First,  a roommate should  be conciderate and polite . For example, when I'm sleeping or studying my roommate shouldn't bother me and should be quiet as a mouse. My roommate and I should care, help, worry and ber polite to each other. To have a good relationship with your roommate, both of you need to be conciderate and be polite to each other. For example, let's prepend that my parents came over to our house. If my roommate is polite to my parents, they will have a great time while staying at our place. But if he is rude and unpolite than my parents will have a hard time staying and they would tell me to move to other house(room).  \\r\\n   Next, your roommate should have a great sense of responsibility. When we share a house, we pay the rent together and divide the housework together. If my roommate has a great sense of responsibility, than he or she would pay the rent on time and do their housework as scheuled. If not my roommate and I would not have a good relationship. While I was staying in Singapore, I had to live with my roommate, who had no sense of responsibility. He didn't pay the rent on time, didn't do the housework.  For one word he was a trouble maker. After all we had problems so I moved out. To be trusted by other person you need to have a great responsibility.\\r\\n   In short, it is not hard to become a good roommate to me. The qualities of a good roommate are concideration, politeness, and responsibility.  To have a good relationship with your roommate, both of you need to be conciderate and be polite to each other. And if my roommate wants to be trusted he or she would need a great sense of responsibility.\",\n",

       " ('I believe teachers are the most influential people. Some people even say, “To succeed, you have to meet a good teacher.” Then what good qualities should a good teacher have to have to positively influence students?\\r\\n    One of the qualities is consistency. The consistency of the teacher firstly makes students feel trust. If students do not trust their teacher, how can they learn? If a teacher does things very emotionally, students will feel unstable, meaning that they won’t trust or respect the teacher. For example, once my friend and I didn’t do my homework. The teacher gave me a zero, but my friend was given a second chance, only because the teacher was happy when checking my friend’s homework. This inconsistency made me lose some respect to the teacher. If teachers show consistency, students will learn and gain an important quality of their life. \\r\\n    Another quality what makes a good teacher is patience. Sometimes students can be rude to teachers, but when the teacher just gets mad and fight against the student, the student will not learn from the situation. If the teacher patiently talk and solve the problem, students will learn how to respect and talk. Different from this there is different kind of patience. In a physics class I had some troubles solving a problem. I kept doing the same thing wrong and wrong again. The teacher didn’t get frustrated but patiently kept teaching me the same thing over and over until I understanded. The impression of this teacher is still left in my memory and made me try until I succeed.\\r\\n    I think these two qualities, consistency and patience, are the most important qualities among many qualities of good teachers. Moreover these qualities are what make a good person. Every person should learn these qualities, because every person is a teacher of some kind.',\n",

It is very natural to watch sitcoms with characters with jobs, but unfortunately this makes stereotypes on some occupations.\\r\\n    Doctors are one of the favorite characters, which are selected in sitcoms. Usually they are portrayed as doctors who examine patients. So most children and even adults think that doctors only examine patients. This happens because the media only wants to attract people and this results in a lack of information about occupations. The reality of doctors is not just to examine and give prescriptions, but also do researches, labs and they even write treatise. \\r\\n    Another popular character is a professor.

Nowadays, the issue of whether these animals deserve to be tested or not has been conflicted. Some argue that animal testing is a cruel process that should be banned. However, I strongly disagree with that point of view. If it weren\\'t for animal testing, how can you be sure of the safety of the newly found medicines? \\r\\n     It has been said that animal testing is selfish act of human disregarding the mercy of animals` lives. These lives of animals, as far as the argument goes, are as much precious and significant as that of human. However, if you were to choose between saving a human and a mouse, which one would you pick? The majority of people\\'s answer would be \"human\" and so is mine. Yes, the lives of animals are precious. Are they more precious than that of human? I doubt it. If animal testing is banned, new medicines would be directly tested on human. What if the medicines turned out to be harmful to human? The patients who were tested would die. Humans have emotion and intelligence that is beyond the reach of animals. These facts should provide humans with some privilege such as lives, over animals. \\r\\n     Another argument against animal testing is that science have progressed enough to allow us not to exploit the lives of innocent animals. Such argument assumes that our technology is so superior that there isn\\'t any need to test new medicines on animals. However, this belief is immensely misleading. Without animal testing, our technology would be vulnerable to errors and mistakes. Furthermore, the development of new medicines and vaccines would come to halt. Many scientists are not afraid of making mistakes mainly because they can test their results on animals. They could experiment what was once known as harmful substances on animals and could find cures for diseases. For example, scientists found out that alcohol, which was thought to be a dangerous element to human body, could actually help cure digesting problems. If animal testing is banned, such discovery would not be made often due to the fact that scientists would become too timid to try new antidotes on human. When you are afraid of making mistakes, you can’t make breakthroughs. Prohibiting animal testing is the most extreme way of enlarging the threat of mistakes. \\r\\n     In conclusion, animal testing for new medicines and vaccines should not be prohibited. Our society needs animal testing in order to make a rapid stride into better lifestyles. People who use animal testing to ensure the progress and the result of new vaccines are not wrongdoers harming animals without any reason. They are merely trying to help patients with diseases that don’t have any efficient cure yet. Let’s say you were diagnosed as a terminally ill patient but could be cured with new medicines that were found by animal testing. Shouldn’t you be thankful?',\n",

I asked her what happened. “She was shot when this guy started shooting in school. Didn’t you see the news yet?” This is what Faith told me. I turned the TV on and found out that a 9th grader shot two dead and more than dozen wounded with his dad’s gun. It happened in Santana High School. It was only about 10 minutes away from where I was staying, San Diego. I never imagined such a thing could happen. The 9th grader committed such a crime despite the fact he was not even allowed to possess a gun at the age of 15. Can you even imagine what would happen if there isn’t any age limit for owning a gun? \\r\\n     I absolutely believe there has to be an age limit for owning a gun. The world is dangerous enough without having many gun incidents caused by teenagers or young children. First of all, many teenagers go through fluctuating emotion. They are sometimes too desperate and reckless to think straight. Not having an age limit for owning a gun would only stimulate some of irresponsible actions such as suicide attempts or murdering. Furthermore, young children have chances of firing guns by accidents, thinking they are toys or not knowing what it is.  \\r\\n    I believe the most serious problem that would be caused by not having an age limit for such a threatening weapon is thoughtless actions, which include suicide and manslaughter, caused by teenagers. The reckless actions can be triggered by either simple curiosity or despair they go through as adolescents. The shooting in Santana High School took place because Andy Williams took a grudge toward his friends who teased him. Teasing and bullying happens frequently in high schools. What if every student who was teased brings their guns to school and starts shooting their friends? Teenagers experience frequent shifts in their emotion as well; in one moment, they are happy as if they own the whole world and in the very next one, they can’t see any meaning of lives. These unpredictable fluctuations can lead to a desire for suicide or murder. This can be very dangerous with guns in their hand. Guns are weapon that can easily end person’s life with one simple trigger. The fact that not many of them recognize the danger of it makes the matter worse. Thus, allowing teenagers to possess the weapon from the early age would only make them unaware of the importance of the life and increase the risk of hurting themselves.\\r\\n     Letting young children own their guns is as unsafe as letting teenagers to do so. Many children do not know what the guns are used for. There is a possibility that they might think of it as one of their toys and pull the trigger accidentally, firing the gun. The machine is too dangerous for them. \\r\\n     I assert that teenagers and young children are not responsible enough to own guns. Thus, there needs to be an age limit for possessing them. This is to stop such tragic events similar to what happened in Santana High School about two years ago and wrong judgment made by some adolescents.',\n",

The death penalty is not an effective way of punishing criminals, nor is it an influential mean to deterrent heinous crimes. First of all, the crime rate is irrelevant to the presence of the death penalty. In addition, innocent people were killed by the capital punishment. Lastly, we are disregarding the values of lives when we end prisoners’ lives as if their lives do not mean anything. I believe we have to give criminals another chance to make their lives fruitful, regarding their crimes as one big mistake they have made. \\r\\n     Many incidents happen in the spur of moment; murder, running over a person, firing a gun. In one moment you were merely bickering with your friend and in the next, your friend is dead on the floor. This is how the most crimes take place - starting as a minor problem and then building up with a rapid speed. Therefore, when criminals commit brutal crimes, many of them do not even realize the consequences of such acts. Furthermore, in recent studies, it was shown that many of lawbreakers are under the influences of drugs or alcohols when they carry out their wrongdoings. In short, the death penalty is not imposed as a serious punishment for many of criminals, thus not affecting the crime rates.\\r\\n     We weren’t able to prevent accidental execution of innocent people. More than 400 people were convicted of capital crimes they hadn’t perpetrated and more than 20 of them were already executed. The deaths of those who were innocent cannot be rectified, making the society the murderer of those people. Thus, the death penalty, in which the lives that are as precious as yours depend on the judge’s decisions, leaves too much room for errors.\\r\\n     I consider the death penalty as a cruel act of human neglecting the values of lives. I believe one’s value of life should not be decided by judges since all lives were created equally by God. I also assert that they should have another chance to rectify their mistakes and reconstruct their lives somehow meaningfully. Humans make mistakes all the time and we learn from it. In the same way, criminals might have learn their lessons after their big mistake, commiting a serious crime. \\r\\n     In conclusion, the death penalty is ineffective in many levels. The punishment is against almost every religions and the poll which was in the newspaper article suggested that many citizens disapprove of it. It doesn’t affect the crime rate and is prone to errors which can easily lead to killing innocent people-in another word, murders. Lastly, it is my contention that lives of those who were sentenced to death are valuable and that they deserve another chance to make their life meaningful.',\n",

But I don\\'t think it is Tv that is destroying communications among friends or families. Instead I think Tv can surprising develop communication.\\r\\n  First, Tv can make people communicate. For example, once a week a broadcasting stations broadcasts a program called \"100min debate\". In this program people come out and debate about a certain subject. Last week our family looked and listened to a subject about \"going abroad in a young age\". After watching this program our family gathered and debated about \"going abroad in a young age\", after debating I learned some fact I never thought about and our family had a chance to communicate to each other. And by watching drama I could see and experience the things I never did. At school, most of the student talk about the program(drama and sports) they saw. When I was in a sixth grade, I didn\\'t have many friends but after I watched 2002 Korea, Japan World Cup. I had a chance to make friends by talking about the soccer match. \\r\\n  Second, nobody forces me to watch Tv. If I watch to much Tv, I don\\'t have to blame the person who made Tv, instead I have to blame myself for not controling myself. By watching Tv I can learn many new things and know how the world is going and make friends. If I only watch Tv program that is useful to me than I can communicate with others. \\r\\n  In conclusion, Tv is not responsible for lacking communications among friends or families. Instead Tv is very useful to us. By watching Tv people can communicate about programs they saw,  make friends,  see and experience the things I never did and lastly I can learn many new things and know how the world is going. With out Tv the world will be quite and not fun. Tv produces happiness and makes us communicate with others. Tv is the most important thing humans ever made.',\n",

Regardless of how late I go to bed,  I automatically  wake up around six o’clock every morning. Because of my daily habit  I prefer to get up early in the morning and do my work. During my summer break, I used to wake up late and start my work late. After waking up late, I had to do my work very fast because I had other plans to do that day. Working like a busy ant I had no time to take a rest while working. If I got up early, it would be easier for me to work and take a break.\\r\\n   I'm also very active, and I want to do many things in my life. For example, I want to catch a movie, play golf, go shopping, mountain climing and so on. If I wake up late and start my work, I have less chance of doing the activities I wanted. Therefore I wake up do my work untile three o’clock in the afternoon, then the rest of the day is my free time to do my other activities I wanted.\\r\\n   Lastly, If I do other things before I finish my work than I can no concentrate on my work because I extremely feel  uneasy and stressful . For example, I went shopping with my friend last Sunday in the morning and came back home at approximately six o’clock in the afternoon. While I was shopping I felt every  uneasy and stress because when I get home, tons of work will be waiting for me. Because of my work I can not watch my favorite television show. Although I had fun  shopping with my friends, I could have felt less stress and enjoy Myself more if I had finished my work before going to shopping.\\r\\n   To conclude,  if I get up early there are my postive thing for me. I can do my work while taking breaks, enjoy Myself to other activities I wanted to do, and lastly if I finish my work early than I feel less stress and easy while doing other work. Because of these reasons I prefer to get up early and start my daily work.\",\n",

The teachers tell me to be more self-confident and I would be excellent. They tell me this because I don’t speak a lot in class. But I just don’t know the answer to the question. So I don’t try answering and be foolish. Working-hard is more important than being confident. If one worked hard enough, they would be just naturally confident. We take examinations and ones level of knowledge is decided by that exam. If one knows well about a question, they would get that question correct even is they are not self-confident. For example it’s your first exam and you are in a big hall. Desks are laid all along and the examiner is at the front with a ring and a timer. You are 13-15 years old and you are so unconfident that your body shakes. You wouldn’t get a question such as 7squared wrong. If the teacher thinks you aren’t confident with your self in the casual lessons, ones reports gets more negative sides, but your real future and success is decided by some questions in the exam. So ones hard work and knowledge is more important.',\n",

Korea and Japan are the first Asian country to hold the World cup, so many people got interested in. 32 countries came to Korea and Japan to charge the World Cup. June is the month when Korea got the eyes of the world. \\r\\nBefore the 2002World Cup Korea never went to the second round in the world cups. But thanks to Mr.Guss Hidink the couch of Korea team made a great improvement on soccer players and the standard level of soccer played in Korea. Nobody expected Korea to get into the semi finals all they wish was to win a game in the world cup. When Korea got into the semi finals, the world was surprised and the Koreans were overexcited and some hoped that we could make it to the finals. The soccer players did well but we had to be satisfied on 4th place. During and after the world cup Korea got a lot of benefits.  \\r\\n\\tFirstly, games were broadcasted live and Korea made a video camera that can be seen by slow motions, By this camera all the TV viewers were able to see goals slowly. Korea had a chance to show the world Korea's outstanding digital skills. Most of the foreigners who visited Korea were surprised at the cell phones used in Korea. Because Korea's cell phones were small and easy to carry and had a lot of new technique that other countries didn't have. After the World Cup country started to import cell phones made in Korea. Especially China started to import cell phones made in Korea.   \\r\\n                    Secondly, during the world cup the Koreans wear the Red Devil T-shirt and volunteered to come out to the city hall, Main Street, and Kwang Hwa Moon to watch Korea's game together. About 9millons participated in this event. And after the game they cleaned their spots and there wasn’t' any violence behavior. In stadium everybody cleaned up their spots and there wasn't any Hooligans in Korea and Japan. This scene gave a shock to the world cause there wasn't any country to do this. This manner action was spread to the world and people got to know a country named Korea. This is a marketing to spread our country name and by doing this, people got interested in Korea and started to by objects made in Korea, travel to Korea and so on. After the world I had a chance to see a lot of foreign travelers visit Korea. \\r\\n\\tThirdly, the people of Korea had a great privilege to be a Korean. Before the world cup people had no desire to live because Korea's economic were bad, real bad. Even I was not proud to be a Korean, but after the world cup I was proud to be a Korean. Also the amount of that emigrate stared to reduce after the World cup. You could say that world cup brought many hopes to the Korean.\\r\\n\\tIn conclusion world cup made the world know a small country named Korea and gave many hopes to the Koreans. Because of Korea's outstanding play Korea's FIFA ranking was changed 41th to 22th. If Korea wants to do well against other countries Korea must give funds and help to increase many young soccer player, who will be playing in the world cup 10years later. I wish that in the 2006 German World cup the Korea team would make it to the final and make the world more surprised.\",\n",

       " (\"The cars are everywhere; in the garages of houses, packed on the roads, parking lots, rushing in the highways...... It is not exaggerated to say that the car is one of the inventions that highly contributed to our modern lives. Can you even imagine living without them? How slow and ineffective our lives would be without the amazing invention? I wish to share the convenience and comfort of it with people who lived back in time without the help of nowadays' technology. To be exact, I hope to meet European people in the Middle Ages, a period about 1000 years ago. The religion, commerce and feudal life were the most effective factors for those who lived during the period. There are many reasons why I would like to introduce cars to them. First of all, the cars would have helped European re-capture Jerusalem, the holy city of Christianity, over the course of Crusades. The towns grew bigger and bigger as commerce prospered. There were traders from other countries and towns such as Genoa and Venice. The invention would have contributed to the trading by making transporting and distributing of the goods easier and faster. Lastly, I believe cars could have save many lives when the Black Death was prevailing, enabling people to move to other places before getting infected by it.\\r\\n     Crusades, a holy war to conquer their religious city, was not successful because many knights died before reaching Jerusalem. They were mountains they had to climb over, harsh weather to endure, and endless walking. I, being a Christian, often regretted over the fact that they couldn't acquire the holy city back. Car would have helped the knights. It could have transported them in less than a week whereas it took them more than 3 months to arrive at Jerusalem with only the half of the knights left. Not only it would have protected them from the fickle weather, it would have also reduced the hardship of climbing over the mountains since the modern car is furnished with a powerful engine. Maybe, with the help of cars, they might even be able to acquire the city back this time.\\r\\n     One of the factors that led to the flourish of the Middle Ages was broad trade-markets. Merchants all over the countries and towns gathered in Europe and exchanged goods and ideas. However, it took a lot of time before they could reach Europe since transportations that were accessible were limited. Thus, by the time merchants get to the place, some good had been damaged or lost. Car would have been a great solution to these problems. It would make the trading more efficient with more goods coming into the town with a rapid speed. Air-conditioning in the car would also protect merchandise, such as food, from getting rotten.\\r\\n     The Black Death killed more than one-third of the European population. Some peasants tried to get out from the town to avoid the diseases. However, the speed the disease was spreading was faster than that of human moving away from it. I believe using a car could have decreased the number of deaths caused by such a quick-spreading and fetal disease by quickly transporting medicines and humans.\\r\\n     In conclusion, I would bring a car back to the Middle Ages to help European in many ways. Car can easily contribute to gaining the holy land back from Muslims, even further prospering the commerce, and minimizing the casualty caused by the Black Death. I just hope it would make the lives during the Middle Ages faster and more efficient.\",\n",

       " (\"It is important to have a good roommate if you want to have a good experience studying in overseas or in your country. A major factor for this experience depends on the behavior of my roommate. There are many qualities of a good roommate, but I believe consideration, politeness and responsibility are the most needed and important qualities. \\r\\n   First, my roommate should be considerate. For example, when I'm studying  or sleeping my roommate should not disturb me and should be quite as a mouse. I should also do the same for my roommate. My roommate and I should help, care, and be concern for each other. For example of I had problems with my studings than my roommate can help me with it, or I can help him or her. By helping each other we can  be better friend and get better grades in university.\\r\\n   Second, my roommate and I should be polite to each other’s friends or families in order to have a good a relationship. For example, let's pretend that my parents came to visit  or house If my roommate is polite to my parents, they will have a good time but on the other hand if he's rude than they will have a hard time staying in our house , and I will not like him  that much. \\r\\n   Third, my roommate should have a great sense of responsibility. When we share a house, we also share our rent and house chores.  If my roommate is responsible, he or she would pay the rent on time and do as planed.  While I was living abroading in Singapore, my roommate was a person who did not have responsibility.  He always paid the rent late and didn't did not do his house chores as we have agreed . We had many problems so I moved out. To be good mates, all parties should have great sense of responsibility. \\r\\n    In summary, it is not hard to become a good roommate. The qualities of a good roommates are consideration, politeness and responsibility. To have a good relationship with my roommate, we should be considerate to each other, be polite to ones' friends or families and most of all, we both need a great sense of responsibility.\",\n",

It is not exaggerated to say that the city is one of the most valuable ancient cities that is still well-maintained in Korea. Thus, if a foreigner visited my country, Korea, I would go to Kyung-ju with him. Kyung-ju is loved by many tourists for several reasons. First of all, it is the best place to learn about Korean history. Not only that, it is well-known for its spectacular nature. Lastly, it is suited with various tour services that appealed many tourists.\\r\\n     I believe foreigners visiting Korea would be interested in learning the history of the country as well. Kyung-ju can be thought as a city that progressed correlating with the history of Korea. Being an influencing city from B.C 54, Kyung-ju sustains many precious artifacts. There is no doubt that it would be a great opportunity for foreigners to actually see them. Out of more than 10 historical sights left in Kyung-ju, a star observatory that was first to be ever made and two temples are most famous sights. In addition, there are several museums that explain various transitions made in Korea. A foreigner and I would tour the famous sights and I would explain intriguing facts about Kyung-ju and Korea. \\r\\n     As mentioned ahead, Kyung-ju is surrounded by mountains. This is why it was the capital of Shinra, to protect it from other nations. A lake in the middle of the city adds to the beauty of Kyung-ju. All buildings are regulated not be higher than 5 stories in order to preserve historical scenes. Thus, Kyung-ju is less bustling and polluted than other renowned cities in Korea. Foreigners who have affection toward the nature are likely to enjoy visiting the place.\\r\\n     Lastly, there are many facilities that are available for foreign tourists. Numerous hotels have special programs designed for foreigners. For example, they might be able to introduce them a tour guider, a fluent foreign language speaker. Moreover, there are several restaurants that satisfy both Korean and foreigners’ appetites, eliminating inconvenience foreigners might feel. \\r\\n     In conclusion, if I am to introduce Korean society, culture and history to a foreigner, I would go to Kyung-ju with him.

       " ('There is a saying, \"Heaven helps those who help themselves.\" The moral popped into my head as I was reading Robinson Crusoe. Robinson Crusoe experienced so many troubles and hardships that it made me contemplate how harsh one\\'s life can be. He encountered a storm on his first voyage then on the second, he was enslaved. After narrowly escaping the slavery, it seemed as if Crusoe was going to lead a quiet life in his plantation. However, his misfortune didn\\'t stop. Another storm severely attacked his ship when he was heading to Africa in search for slaves. Shipwrecked, Robinson was drifted to a desolate island. For 24 years, Crusoe lived in the isolated island alone. However, he never gave up hopes and soon adapted to his new life by building homes, learning how to cook, and raising goats and crops. Not only that, but he also learned to satisfy himself in the given situation and that is what makes him so admirable. His determination and optimistic view toward his life might have been keys to his survival. There are many valuable lessons embedded in the writing and I am glad I had a chance to think them over. \\r\\n  \\r\\n  First of all, by reading the book, I found out that perseverance brings success in lives. It was Crusoe\\'s determination that prevented him from giving up hopes or fearing the challenges. He encountered challenges in island with persistent effort and later his hard work paid off. When he finally boarded to a ship leading to his home, I thought, \"If Crusoe was able to compete with the nature with his determination, I can cope with my troubles in the same way!\"  \\r\\n\\r\\n  If one asks Robin Crusoe if the glass is half full or half empty, he is most likely to pick the former as his answer. Facing the problems with positive perspectives is very crucial in our lives and the story of Crusoe depicted it very well. What would have happened if he was a  pessimistic person? He could have gone insane because there are too many things to worry about in the island. How we regard the problems can change the result dramatically. I learned that if you face them confidently and optimistically, the result would be promising. If you have to face the problem, why face it with a frowning face?  From now on, I would see the world in optimistic view like Crusoe did.\\r\\n\\r\\n  I learned another lesson through Crusoe\\'s flawed action. An ironic part I found very intriguing was Crusoe wanting to enslave Africans for his plantation after he, himself, narrowly escaped the slavery from pirates. Crusoe praying for god\\'s help only if he is in tough conditions is another paradox. As if god condemned his behaviors, Crusoe was deserted in the island. I realized that \"you should do onto others as you want them to do onto you-Socrates\" or you will be punished.\\r\\n\\r\\n  This adventure book held my attention until the very end. How Crusoe struggled and overcame hardship helped me realize several valuable lessons. Robinson Crusoe is a book that changed my conducts and aspects toward the world. From this moment, I will always think how Crusoe endured his harsh life and set him as my role model to some extent. Some extent, it is, because I do not approve his attitude toward Negro. I should also be thankful in my given situation because I have friends and family around me to rely on whereas Crusoe had none. On a scale from 1 to 10, I would rate this book a perfect 10.',\n",

In every vacation, we listen many news about accidents, especially at beaches. Small children are so weak and cannot swim well that they are easily drowned. Then, most of their parents jump into the water to save their children rishking their lives. Thins is very distinguished quality which only parents show when their loved children are in dager.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome people obtain courage through difficulties. A heroine of a famous novel,\"Gone with the wind\", Scarlet, was a girl who was very pretty and loved by most of boys in the town and is rather selfish.She had been grown up on a bed of roses, and never tasted the bitter cup of life. However, going through hardships, parting with beloved people, and helping casualties during the war, she became strong and kind to others . In addition, even when her lover, Ret, whom she devoted her life for, she did not give up and was bravely rose up to protect her valuable farm, Tara.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese two examples I mentioned above show us that even common people who usually are not brave could be courageous, if they face urgent and pressing situations.

Some people say that those people should be forgived, however, I think ignorance is no excuse for violating the law. Because law should judge crimes with results, not by process and it is possible that crimianls pretend to be ignorant purposely. \\r\\n\\r\\nIf we excuse criminals for their ingnorance, they possibly pretend to be ignorant. Let's say that a person breaks a traffic regulation saying not to drive in a speed over 100km per hour in a certain road. However, if there is a such excuse, he could avoid getting a traffic ticket pretending to be not awared of the law, even though he/she has could nearly cause serious accidents.\\r\\n\\r\\nEven the criminals were mental patients who were not know about the law, they cannot be exceptions as long as they harm other people. A few months ago, a man caused a big fire in the subway  with an explosive, which killed humdreds people. During the investigation, it was turned out that the man was a mental patient, however, he finally got a death sentence. Although he was not awared that what he did was a big crime, and could not control himself, he should be punished for hurting too many victims and their families.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery people who violate the laws should not be excused whether they are ignorant of the law or not, because at any rate, they infringe people's happiness and security; there should be no exceptions.

Groping about, you feel something unpleasant but there is no way to know what it is.  \\r\\n      The above illustration shows what it would be like to be deprived of a sense of sight.

You would not believe how hard it was! Without having any idea which direction I was going, I almost fall over the stairs. Feeling desperate and frustrated, I had sudden desire to just take off the blindfold and see what lays in front of me. After bumping into so many objects, my legs were bruised, nevertheless, I felt grateful that I possess the sense of sight after all.

I personally think that doctors should not be prosecuted for assisting in the suicide of a termially ill patient. Because people suffer from these as they go on and some occasions, they wish to kill themselves where they do not want to live anymore suffering and just die easily not suffering. Here are some reasons why I do not think the doctors should be prosecuted.\\r\\n     First, people have rights to choose what they are going to do. Although the law might not allow people to commit a crime, helping someone when others are in terminally ill diseases are different. For example, if you are in a lung cancer. You have to pay everyday just to support yourself. You know yourself that everyday you are not living a happy life and in the same time, you are hurting your family financially. Doctors can help you kill yourself in a peaceful way. That way it will be benevolent to everyone.\\r\\n     Secondly, doctors should be allowed to help kill someone if they agree. The patient who suffers everyday, if they want to, what is the point if anyone is going to die painfully, why not help the person to shorten the death and die peacefully without pain? Why are patients painfully killing themselves better than patients killing themselves at their will peacefully ? Why can't doctors help patients die in a better way?\\r\\n     In conclusion, I think that doctors helping terminally ill patients to commit a suicide should not be prosecuted because it helps the person in a lot of ways. It helps people to live their life peacefully and die peacefully without dying painfully and the doctors are doing their job, helping people.\",\n",

First of all, he doesn’t fear changes or challenges. In addition, he is patient and generous when his employees make mistakes because he sees them as stepping-stones to his success. Not only that, but a wise leader also respect employees’ ideas and suggestions.\\r\\nLastly, a good leader should realize the burden of his responsibility and use his power justifiably. \\r\\n     I believe that changes bring about success. This reminded me of a book, “Who Moved My Cheese.” In the book, Sniff and Scurry quickly encountered the fact that someone moved their cheese and adapted to it by striving to find another heap of cheese. However, afraid of facing the truth, Hem and Hoe kept denying the change. In the end, it was Sniff and Scurry who found a mound of cheese, even bigger than the former one. Good leaders are like Sniff and Scurry; they wisely face changes and challenges without hesitation, believing that delaying accepting the truth would only make the matter worse. \\r\\n     There is a saying, “Failure is a mother of success.” A good leader has the saying embedded in their hearts. Thus, he isn’t impatient when minor mistakes occur. For example, if a scientific experiment did not succeed because an employee made a mistake by not putting a certain chemical ingredient, a good leader would be lenient about it, believing that it would prevent other mistakes from happening.\\r\\n     A prominent leader respect other people’s ideas and suggestions, in the same way that a respected president pays a close attention to citizen of a country he is representing. People in lower positions can have better ideas than the leader. Thus, a wise leader breaks barriers between an employer and employees and learns new ideas from them.\\r\\n     If a leader makes a wrong judgment, the whole group would fail. Thus, being a leader of a company, country, or any group requires responsibility. For example, when a president considers whether to go to a war, he has to contemplate all the consequences that would follow; casualties, his country’s reputation, financial loss...... In short, a good leader should learn the seriousness of it and try not to use their power recklessly.\\r\\n     In conclusion, good leaders have to be suited with certain quality. He should see changes as his chance to experience other situations, which in turn, make him wiser. Being generous to people who follow him appreciating their ideas are other characteristics. An influential leader should also learn to cope with his heavy responsibility.',\n",

I dislike smelling the smoke, it makes my eyes hurt and makes me cough. About a year ago I use to go to the PC room with my friends. Sometime people smoke their cigars.

I could see the plants, animals, food, insect all the things I learned in school book and experience things I never did before. \\r\\n\\tSecond, I have more time to spend with my family. When I was in Singapore I didn't go to school on weekends so our family went on vacations. During the vacation we talked a lot and did the activity we commonly liked, such as golf. By spending a lot of time with families, we can have stabilized family and stable society.\\r\\n\\tThird, after school I go directly to my academy school and return home about 11 o' clock or later. Because of my schedule I don't have that much time to study, review and prepare for the next day. If there is 5school days a week than I could review, prepare for my next class and study. \\r\\n\\tLastly, Some people say if we do 5school days a week, there would be longer class every day, but all we have to do is just study one more hour and enjoy ourself during the weekend. Many Korean students get stress by studying 6days a week, and some commit suicide. I  once saw in a newspaper that student in American release there stress on weekends, so there aren't many students committing suicides because of school stress.\\r\\n\\tIn conclusion, we could have positive, creative thoughts and have better relationship in result to 5school days a week. Also By spending a lot of time with family we can have more stabilized family and stabilized society. Also by study, reviewing and preparing for the next day I can be more responsible. Because of this positive facts I agree with the 5school days a week.\",\n",

Therefore, I agree that there should be an age limit for owning a gun.\\r\\n     First, gun can be very dangerous if it is not used carefully. Gun can easily harm people after few steps, get a gun, load a gun, then shoot. Allowing children, who watches the movies or TV shows can easily use a gun like anybody else does and who does not have an ability to decide whether something is good or bad, can be a dangerous business. Which can put children into a danger which cannot be limited if not by setting an age limit.\\r\\n     Secondly, seniors who cannot control the gun very well is also a problem. Although the seniors who used the gun before might control the gun very well, it is very likely that those people lost their stability after some aging process. They might be in such dangerous situation that they need a gun, the possibility of seniors shooting a pedestrian is bigger than possibility of non-seniors shooting a pedestrian. Therefore, allowing seniors to own a gun nearly as dangerous as allowing children to own a gun.\\r\\n     In conclusion, I think that there should be an age limit for owning a gun both for young and old.

This shows how fast information is traveling through the network. You must keep in mind that it is computers that make it all possible.\\r\\n     Also, computers have made my life comfortable. Before computers appeared in the public, people had to go to a bookstore to buy books. If books you wanted were not available, you had to order it through a bookstore, which can took up to a month, or simply not read it. However, this no longer happens in contemporary world. With one simple click, you can buy any book you wish to read through Internet and it is mailed to you in less than a week. Items that are sold via Internet are not limited to books, of course. Clothes, shoes, flowers, furniture......-all the things you can think of-are sold through Internet shopping mall. This reduces inconvenience of actually visiting the towns. It is also helpful when you need things that are not normally sold in stores because items in Internet shopping mall are so diverse. An ability to manage your bank accounts through Internet also lifts off the burden of having to visiting banks frequently. The usage of computers improved our lifestyles in various ways. \\r\\n     Computers are important links that connect many countries together. As mentioned before, you can easily know what is happening in other parts of the world by using computers. Emailing and chatting even allow people to get to know people from different culture.

Because ozone layers are destroyed, many people suffered skin cancer while global warming melted glaciers and almost submerged an island. Does this sound like an appealing world to you? To me, it sounds as if a modern world is in a complete chaos. One should keep in mind that it was technology that played a major role in creating the environmental problems. As technologist cut down trees to make factories and created chemical substances that are harmful to nature, the environment became more vulnerable to human activities and was badly harmed by them. \\r\\n     To worsen the problem, several social problems were aroused as side-effects of technology. First of all, modern people only think about themselves. As many people competed to get more advantages out of technology, became selfish. Thus, not caring how badly their misbehavior would affect the neighbors, environment, or public properties. Technology also promoted a huge gap between the rich and the poor. People with an access to technological advances would easily get wealthy whereas people who do not have such access would get poorer and poorer. \\r\\n     In conclusion, I do not agree that technology bettered our lives. Many people are blinded to the fact that technology is harming our environment and relation between people. It is time for them to look at the side-effects of the world drenched with technological advances - the world filled with environmental problems, selfish people, and immeasurable gaps between the poor and the rich. People should look at the world in a long term and recognize how serious the problems are.',\n",

Many people think of someone like Adolf Hitler or Joseph Stalin, those of who did not have good character. However, I disagree that most good leaders have not been people of good character.\\r\\n     Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin are good examples of successful leaders who did not have good character. However, there are only few leaders who were not people of good character. For example, Franklin D. Roosevelt was a president for United States in Second World War era. He was a successful leader for United States and a people of good character. Although he died later of Polio, he made alliance with all allies in the Second World War, and United States and the Allies were victorious in the war. He was a person of good character and also a good leader.\\r\\n     Although some good leader might have been a person of a bad character, it does not mean that we can categorize good leaders as a people of bad characters. Also known as stereotyping, if one or two people does same thing, people start to think others in the group are the same. However, I do not think people should think that way. Another example is Martin Luther King Jr., He was one of the famous leaders of the black people. In 1963, he lead the his people and fought for the equality. He did not have a bad character. He was a perfect person.\\r\\n     In conclusion, I disagree that most good leaders have not been people of good character.

However, as many historical events shows, most of the changes that have benefited us were the results of violent upheavals rather than gradual improvements.\\r\\n     Korea, a country which was once colonized by Japan was only able to regain freedom through the use of force in a violent war. Who knows what would have happened if the war didn’t take place? We might still be living under the imperial colonization of Japan. Before the World War II started, many patriots tried protesting against the Japanese by running into the street with Korean flags on their hands. This can be thought of as a gradual improvement. However, this only led to Japanese soldiers torturing Koreans who protested. Also, the mistreatment toward Koreans became much more severe and harsh. Thus, it can be said that the gradual improvements can easily be stifled whereas violent upheaval affects the situation more dramatically and paves the way for the most lasting social changes. \\r\\n     Violent upheaval, such as wars and revolutions, can turn the tides of social changes. For example, after the United States defeated Japan in World War II, Korean could immediately gain their freedom back and pave the way for gradual improvement that led to events that motivated Korea to progress economically and politically. Thus, violent upheaval is a crucial factor that brings about gradual improvements which in turn lead to the most lasting social changes.\\r\\n     In conclusion, I believe great upheaval is more effective than a gradual change when it comes to a lasting social change as many historical events show.',\n",

There are other aspects students need to focus on over the course of learning. There are three other most important lessons coupled with good grades that a good education should embody. They are creative thinking processes, learning to interact and socialize with others, and following the rules. Thus, a good education can be thought of as an interesting game in which you learn all the lessons that are necessary in life.\\r\\n     Almost every team with good records is known for having brilliant strategies. By positioning players in way that other teams cannot predict and carefully planning every movement, the team is getting closer to winning. Good strategies come from creative thinking. In similar ways, a good education goes along with imaginative thinking process. As good strategies were keys to winning games, creative thinking process would act as a foundation for achieving your goal.\\r\\n  Soccer teams are made up of 11 players, basketball teams are formed with 5 players, and baseball teams are composed of 9 players. It is very hard to find any game played by one person. You learn to cooperate and collaborate with others through games. Just like any sport, classes are consisted of many people. There are many programs that involve students working with others in school. Through the programs, students learn to respect and socialize. This skill is very crucial because you would have to cooperate with others in your work, job, and social life later on. \\r\\n     Lastly, there are rules players have to abide by in order make the game work. If they do not follow them, the referee would give warning or even order the players off the field. In school, students learn to comply with rules that are set up by teachers or themselves. How chaotic the school would be if students come to school whenever they feel like? Thus, rules act as systems that keep the school together. If he does not learn to follow the rule, he would later disturb the social order.\\r\\n      Instead of thinking education as a boring process, students should think of it as a game in which you learn various skills that would later act as a stepping stone for future success.',\n",

On the contrary, if the filmers filmed only the Manhattan area especially in the highly developed areas, the viewers will think that the whole New York is a highly developed area. Both of the examples filmed New York, but in a different angle.\\r\\n     In conclusion, I think people who make television shows, movies, commercials or popular songs stereotype people by writing or filming things in 'their' ways or by filming in a different angle.\",\n",

People can easily get addicted to it and once you get addicted, it becomes extremely hard to stop taking drugs unless you go to rehabilitatation center. If one gets addicted to marijuana, that person will keep buying drugs in the dark markets. That person will lose money and in the same time, the person will suffer from a lot of side affects such as attention disorder and depression. However, the person will not know what he is doing.

Most patients who want to end their lives are who have been ill for very long time. They want to die mainly because they are exhausted with painful and hopeless struggle against disease. However, not a small number of people consider death because they hate to bother their families any more or the expenses of continuing prolong their lives is too burdensome. In such case, a patient's right to control his own death will oblige him to choose death; his real right about own life is disregarded.\\r\\n      The other reason is that men have no right to choose their own death as well as other's. This is not limited to only terminally ill people but is applied to everyone. I believe that as we are born under God's plan, and our deaths are also under God's authority. Whether someone is in illness or not, and whether in hopeless conditions or not, if he is alive, that means God's plan for him is not competed yet; and he must expect God's next plan for him.\\r\\n      As shown above, because all humans belong to God, they shouldn't have the right to control their own death.

While studing some students get private lessons or attent school academy. Since we study hard we don\\'t have much time to play with friends , have creative thoughts or minds to help and love others.\\r\\n     First, Korean students study in order to apply to a good collage. Sine they study hard they have more knowledge. However Korean students are lack of education for being a whole man. They don\\'t love, respect, or give special consideration to others. For an example, I once saw a high school student being rude to older people and some students do not respecting adults. \\r\\n     Second, studentss do not study hard in schools. Instead they study at private academies or get lessons. I read an artical in the newspaper saying that \\r\\n\\'Koreans spend a lot of money on their childs eudation \". Students should learn more at school and reduce the amount of money spending on academies. In order to do that school should teach more to students. \\r\\n     Lastly, Korean students can not enjoy their lifes. Every day all they do is studing . And because of that student have less chance of making new firends and doing other activities. Most of all they can not exprience the large world.  When I was in Singapore  I met with my friends about  three times a week , exprience  many other things and did activities. But after I came back to Korea, a rarly meet my friends and have less chance of enjoying my hobbies.\\r\\n      In conclusion, It is a good thing to study hard but students do not have much freedome and they spend much money on private education. To become a successful person one should be good a studying and also should know how to enjoy their life. Other countries education system lasts about 10 to 20 years, but Koreas education system last for about 3 years and changes often. I would like to make an education system that lasts more than 10 years.  These are the reasons why I want to change Koreas education system.',\n",

But the main reason was to fight for the oils. Other countries knew this was a war for no reason, because of this fact they decided not to help U.S during the war.  After winning the war, U.S requested countries to send military troops to help rebuild IRAQ. when people in Korea herd this new there were many controversy weather to send troops or not. I am one of the person who thinks Korea should send troops to IRAQ. \\r\\n     First, Korea should send troops because  people in IRAQ need help. During the war many innocent people were killed and their homes were destroyed. These people need our help to rebuild their country. For an example, in the Korean war many countries helped us to rebuild our society. Since Korea received many help we should also help other countries.\\r\\n     Second, like strong animals rule the kingdom, so does the world. Powerful countries rule the world. One of the powerful country is U.S. IF they say something weak countries have to listen to it. If they do not obey it, their country would  face tremendous loss. By sending troops U.S might help our economy and a better country.\\r\\n     Lastly, by helping IRAQ, Korea could import the oils for a lower price. Befor the war Korea imported oils for about Millions of Dollars, but by helping IRAQ rebuild, their government would probably feel thankful to us and sell oils for a lower price. \\r\\n      In conclusion, people in IRAQ need help to start a new life and Korea could import oils for a lower price than before. Also U.S could improve our economy. By helping them we could also get help from IRAQ when needed. These are the reasons why I think Korea should send troops to IRAQ.',\n",

       " (\"Korea is a country that has over 5000years of history. Among the 5000years of history Korea had experienced many ups and downs. I sometimes think of going back to the past and help Korea be a better country than today. When I go back I would do my best to change the history of my nation. There are two places I want to go, and that the time before our country was taken over by Japan and the Korean War.\\r\\n\\tFirst, I want to back to the time before japan took over Korea. Korea has been taken over by Japan from 1910~1945. In this period many Koreans were killed and they were treated like animals by the Japanese. The Japan government made Koreans to speak japanese and follow it culture. Few people did what they were told, but most of the Koreans worked as an independent soldiers and fought for Koreas freedom. If I go back I would tell the people and independent soldiers what to do and what will happen because I learned it from our school. The main reason why Korea was invaded by Japan is because we had no power and lack of advanced weapons. If Korea government had accepted America of other countries culture and weapons we would have enough power to fight and win japan. I would go to the Koreas king and make him believe that I am from the future and would tell him what to do.  To be able to change this situation would be to change the consciousness of our people and perhaps alter other events of last 100years. \\r\\n\\tSecond, I want to go back to 1950 years.  In this period Korea fought each other called the Korean war . The result of the fight led us to break into 2 countries and live with 38degree line. Our people were so silly to kill each other. About 3 millions people were dead and there were many homeless people and some families were separated. Also  Koreas economics was lack of improvement. Once a year there are about 1~2 time where South And North Korea separated families meet and find there lost ones. As I see these event on Tv, it makes my heart cry and makes me think why did we have to fight each other and live separated. I would go back to the past and would stop the fight from the beginning and make them reunite again.\\r\\n\\tIn conclusion, I want to go back to the past, prevent accidents and  change the history of Korea. By doing these many people will not suffer or die. If I go to the Koreas king in 1910 and tell him what to do, than Korean will accept different kinds of cultures and advanced technology such as weapons. By using these weapons Korea could prevent japan from invading them. And also by preventing the fights of Korean there would be no Korean war. If there were no war there wouldn't be families living in separated areas, also Korea would be bigger and more powerful than other countries. I hope one day I would be able to change Koreas history.\",\n",

But there are so many possibilities if cloning becomes legal. When we do not even know that cloning is even possible, we cannot really judge what can happen in this world after cloning becomes possible. But allowing cloning gives us limitless possibilities, because cloned beings might aid this world to be a better place. Like the saying, 'Two is better than one', having more people can help us because with more people thinking, we have more ideas than we have right now. \\r\\n     Cloning can let us do things that we were unable to do or never tried to do. Although producing human beings and using them for a experimental purposes are not moral at all, cloning people can let us experiment things that was unable to perform. For example, we can test cloned beings for newly introduced drugs. Because cloned beings are no different than a real person, execpt that they are cloned, thay will have the similar reactions to things. Therefore, we can see whether the drug is successful or not and distrubute them in the market. \\r\\n     In conclusion, I think allowing cloning can allow limitless possibilities and aid us in a way that we cannot do ourselves.\",\n",

If a patient is feeling pain everyday of their lives and cannot tell what they want to do because they are in serious diseases, someone should be able help them die peacefully.

Most of the students in Korea study hard to go to college. While studying Korean students take private lessons. Since Korean students study hard, they have less time to make friends, enjoys one's life, and most of all lack of experience.\\r\\n      First, I would change Koreas education system. Korean students just study hard to attend famous universities such as Seoul- University. It is positive to study hard but there are some negative effect on just studying hard. Korean student have less opportunity to face, experience the world. I heard that many foreign student travel to a lot of countries during holidays. For my own experience, when I was in Singapore our used to go travel countries during my summer holiday and winter break. By traveling I had a chance to experience the different cultures and learn more about the world, and I seldom had luck to see the things I had learned in school. I personally think in order to succeed a person needs to study hard and also have more experience than orders. A few Korean students do not have the power to consider orders or help, they just think about themselves. For an example, a student in my class needed fell down on the stairs and nobody cared about him. After seeing this I felt that our Korean education system should be changed.\\r\\n         Second, a lot of money is spent for private lessons and Koreans need to reduce the amount of money spent. In one survey Korea ranked number 1 country to spend the most money on private studying. All the Korean student feel they need to study more or need support with their studying, so they choose to take private lessons. This private lessons are expensive and students really do not need them. For an example 90% of students in my class take private lessons. Foreign student rarely take private lessons. They do their studies in school. If they need help schools make special class after school for them. When I become the president of Korea I would make students do all of the learning in school and reduce the amount of money used for private lessons. \\r\\n        In conclusion, there are many things that need to be changed but I think Koreas education system should be changed quickly. By the moment I become the president of Korea I would give less stress, more chance to experience the world and more freedom but more responsibility to students. I would also try to reduce the amount of money spent for private lessons. These are the things I would change when I become the president of Korea.\",\n",

We watch television to watch news and see what is going on in this world or watch other televisions shows to entertain ourselves. In the shows we watch everyday, characters usually have a job. Although the job is usually to show what the character does, sometimes it ends up showing the wrong portrayal and sometimes end up creating stereotypes.\\r\\n     In reality, jobs can be hard but most of the people work hard to do what they are supposed to do. Although in some television shows, they show people working hard, there are some shows that use a particular occupation to create a joke or to overexaggerate what people do in reality. For example, in the hit show 'The Simpsons', Homer Simpson is a worker in a powerplant. Although the shows purpose is to entertain people, Homer actually does nothing in the powerplant else than eating donuts or making troubles. However, this is not what real workers in powerplant does, what real workers does is keeping the powerplant safe and provide us with electricity, not eating donuts.\\r\\n     People can be different from what we see everyday. Such as janitors in school or teachers in school. They might seem like a mean person or a bad person to our eyes, but what they are doing is helping us. But in television shows, it can only show what the author or the producer sees. Again, in the show 'The Simpsons', principal in Bart's school always seems to yell or kick Bart out of the school. Although real principals might be yell sometimes, but what they do is to make the school a better place for students. Not to kick Bart because he hates Bart.\\r\\n     In conclusion, I think television shows represents particular occupation by overexaggerating or showing it in the way they see it and not showing what they really do.\",\n",

Although laws do catch and punish crimials infringe upon the rights of law-abiding people, laws are primarily meant to encourage people not to commit crimes in the first place because if there nobody commits crime in the first place, there will be nobody who are going to get punished.\\r\\n     If there are no crimes in the first place, there will be nobody to catch or punish, and when anybody infinges upon the law-abiding people, then they catch and punish criminals by the law. Because the laws usually say if anyone commits a crime, they will get caught and punished, even people who thinks about it, will cancel their ideas because they do not want to get punished. However, the laws were to made stop people from commiting crimes in the first place, not encourage people to commit crime and get caught and punished.\\r\\n     Although laws were primarily meant to encourage people not to commit crimes in the first place, it also serves as a role to catch and punish people who had already commited a crime. Because if the law can only encourage people not to commit crime in the first place, some people would think, why not commit a crime when there are no differences commiting and not commiting. However, because laws catch and punish criminal, it does not necessarily mean that it was 'meant' to catch and punish criminal, but rather to encourage people not to commit crimes in the first place.\\r\\n     In conclusion, although laws do have a ability to catch and punish criminals, I do not think it was 'meant' to catch and punish, but rather to encourage people not to commit crime in the first place.\",\n",

When people electrified people to death decades ago, both executers and criminals had risk because both executers and criminals had risk of getting electrified anytime. However, injecting poison is more reliable because it is safe for both people and there are no possibilities that the criminal will come alive unlike sometime when they electrified.\\r\\n     Executing by other ways were harder for both executers and the criminal. Because executers had to see the criminals suffering from pain and criminals had to suffer more than they really had to. However, by injecting poison into criminal's body, executers had to see less pain from the criminals and criminals died faster and painless. Therefore, by injecting poison into one's body is more practical than any other ways of executing.\\r\\n     In conclusion, I think methods of execution is reliable and practical because it does not give any possibilities of criminals not dying from the execution and it is better for both executers and the criminals.\",\n",

       " ('If I became the president of Korea, there would be many things I would like to change. The first thing I would like to change is the education system of Korea. Most of the students in Korea study hard to go to college. While studying, Korean students take private lessons. Since Korean students study hard, they have less time to make friends, enjoy life, and most them lack of life and world travel experience.\\r\\n      First, I would change Korea\\'s education system. Korean students just study hard to attend famous universities such as Seoul-University. It is good to study hard, but there are some negative effects of just studying hard. Korean students have less opportunity to experience the world. I heard that many foreign student travel to a lot of countries during holidays. For my own experience, when I lived in Singapore our family used to travel countries during my summer holiday and winter break. By traveling I had a chance to experience the different cultures and learn more about the world, and I seldom saw the things I had learned in school such as the Golden Gate Bridge, Wall Street and the pyramid. Traveling made me become more mature and improve my knowledge. My parent say \"studying is not the most important thing, a man needs to experience other cultures and people\" By doing that a person can earn and learn more things than to study by text book. I personally think in order to succeed a person needs to study hard and also have more experience than others. \\r\\n         Second, a lot of money is spent for private lessons and Koreans need to reduce the amount of money spent. In one survey, Korea was ranked as  the number one country to spend money on private studying. All  Korean students feel they need to study more or need support with their studying, so they choose to take private lessons.  Over 90% of students in my class take private lessons. This private lessons are expensive and students really do not need them, because we learn them at schools and if we concentrate while studying we really do not need private lessons. Foreign students rarely take private lessons. They do their studies in school. If they need help schools make special classes after school for them. When I became the president of Korea, I would make students do all of the learning in school and try to reduce the amount of money used for private lessons. \\r\\n        In conclusion, there are many things that Korea needs to be changed, but I think Korea\\'s education system should be changed quickly. Because in order to make students that will represent our country, we need stabilized education system.  If I became president of Korea I would give less stress, more chances to experience the world, and more freedom but more responsibility to students. I would also try to reduce the amount of money spent for private lessons. These are the things I would change when I become the president of Korea.',\n",

       " ('\"No utopia is perfect,\" said Arthur C. Clarke in his novel 2001: A Space Odyssey. As humans strive to improve their lives, catastrophes happen. Natural disasters with devastating effect occur; however, the greastest calamities are the caused by ourselves. Examples of the extinction of dodos, the Columbia Shuttle disaster, and HAL 9000 in 2001: A Space Odyssey all demonstrate this point.\\r\\n     Dodos were rather common birds in Madagascar until humans introduced a prey that would ultimately make dodos extinct. Only after the dodos were introduced in Lewis Caroll\\'s Alice in Wonderland did people realize that they would never see something again. Various campaigns and movements started after this, but no effort was enough to bring back a bird that we would never see again. Because humans failed to realize the potential effects of their actions, dodos disappeared.\\r\\n     It is easy to overlook the importance of trivial details. Nobody had expected the Columbia Shuttle to disintegrate during its re-entry to the Earth\\'s atmosphere. After hundreds of successful missions, any success was taken for granted. As NASA engineers started to research, they found out that it was a lack of attention to the details that caused the disaster. If someone had meticulously checked through the shuttle, this disaster could have been prevented. But if one fails to look into the details, disasters occur.\\r\\n     In Arthur C. Clarke\\'s 2001: A Space Odyssey, HAL 9000 is the most technologically advanced computer in the world. It is given the task to control a plane and its two astronauts heading towards Jupiter. Despite the \"near perfect\" programming done to HAL, it inevitably makes a mistake; it kills one of the crew on board. HAL was made by the humans to ensure the crew\\'s safety during the flight to Jupiter. Instead, it jeopardizes by killing them.\\r\\n     As humans, we trust ourselves more than anything else. We take most pride on our own creations such as HAL. However, because of this arrogance, we make mistakes that lead to the greatest calamities that are much worse than any natural disasters.',\n",

Every country  or person has different thoughts about the qualities of a good son or daughter. All sons and daughters try to be a good to their parents. I think the most important qualities of a good son or daughter is to respect our parents. We should be polite and listen to their advices because they are good for us. Also a good sons and daughters should try do one's best on everything, never make one's parents worried, and to grow up to be a good man or woman.\\r\\n                First, all sons and daughters  should respect their parents. I always respect my parents by being polite to them and alway listen to my parents advice. My parents gave birth to me and  raised  me up. They spend a lot of money on my education, love, care, and sacrifice their life for me. I once remember the time when I was 10years old and I had a high fever in the middle of the night so my dad hugged me and ran to the hospital. While I was in hospital bed my mom did not sleep for 3nights. She stayed right next to me  and held my hand and prayed for me. After I saw this I felt happy to have a family that loves and cares for me. From that moment I started to respect my parents more. When my parents give advice to me I mostly follow their advice because my parents lived longer than me and knows the world better. By listening to them it helps me with my life. For an example, my mom warned me not to go our at night with my friends because it is dangerous and there is a possibility I might meet a gangster. I ignored my moms advice and went out at night.

Every day Chain is developing and improving quickly, because of this reason many people say china will be the leading country in the 21 century. I also  agree with the statement above. In my opinion 40 to 50 years later China would become the most powerful and leading country. \\r\\n                First, China had large land, resources and over 12 billion people living. The huge amount of population is the main reason why so many people think China will be the leading country in the 21 century. I once read in a newspaper that China has a probability of 2 genius born in a day. In few years there would be many genius than other country and these genius will be leading China.  Also many Chinese live around the world. By living in other countries Chinese can learn new technology or expand ones\\' knowledge and when they come back to China, they can help China develope. 12 billions people working hard, this could give them enough funds to invest their country.\\r\\n             Second, most of the things we use are \"made in China\" . In China it is hard to find a high paying job, and they can\\'t earn enough money because of the large population. So many industry companies build their company in China, because of cheap labor. In China your could get 7 people to work for you just for 100dollars. Since many foreign companies are located I China. China could learn technologies from the company and use it to improve their country. \\r\\n                In conclusion China has a lot of population, resources and can use labor for a low price. This is the reason why many reason companies are located in China. Also these companies could earn a fortune. Think about 12 billion drinking a can of coke, than the coke company would make a fortune. These are the reason why I think China would be the leading country in the 21 century.',\n",

       " (\"Humans are mortal. Sooner or later, they face death. Sometimes, a person has an accident, or acquires an incurable illness, and becomes unable to be cured. These people are called 'the terminally ill'. Most of these people end up in a hospital ,connected to a myriad of life-support machines until their death. However, a few of these people are asking for the right to choose one's own death. They want to die with dignity, not like a doll attached to machines.\\r\\n  Society is not sure of what to do. Some people say that even though these terminally ill people have no hope of recovery, they are human, and for that reason, they should be kept alive as long as possible, regardless of the patient's desire. They claim that if these terminally ill people have the right to control their fate, they will unnecessarily ask for death, thinking that the hospital bills are too much of a burden. \\r\\n  Others say that a person has his/her rights to die with dignity. If they are going to die anyway, they want to die at least with pride. They don't want to die as a doll connected to various life-support machines. It would be useless to try to live just a day or two longer with the support of machines. One would hardly look like a human that way. Instead, one would rather die a few days earlier, but like a human.\\r\\n  All humans die after time. I believe one has the right to choose his/her own fate. Although these terminally ill people might need machines just to stay alive, they are human, and they have the right to an honorable death, just like everyone else. Sociery should help these patients as much as they can. However,  It should be the patient, not society, who should have the right to make decisions.\",\n",

       " ('Mankind has steadily evolved since its advent. In the progress, man has created many inventions. The world that we live in today is moving at a faster pace than ever before, and new devices are coming into existence every few weeks. Looking around at my surroundings, I often wonder how history could have been altered if these inventions had existed in the past. What we know about the renaissance age would have turned out quite differently from what it was had it been for the existence of the camcorder and the vaccine for pest. These two inventions would have made the renaissance a better age to live in, and helped us get a better idea of how the era was like.\\r\\n\\tThe renaissance was a chaotic age. This was an age when many things of the past changed a great deal. Until the renaissance age, art was completely religious, dealing only with God, Jesus, and other holy people. However, during the renaissance, artists began to focus more on nature and humans. Artists and sculptors were fascinated by how humans move and look, and created many artworks of humans. Musicians veered away from religious verses and began to sing lighter, merrier songs. Architects started building in a new style, instead of the strict gothic style so frequently used during the medieval era. Science also saw profound changes. Copernicus declared that the earth goes around the sun, changing the medieval way of understanding space. The compass and gunpowder were imported for the first time from china, causing great change in navigation and military strategy. With the compass, European sailors were able to sail further than ever before, facilitating marine trade. Gunpowder made armor useless, throwing the knight class off their position of authority. Literature also changed a great deal. Many writers of that time adopted Greek and Roman styles that were nearly forgotten during the medieval times. However, some things still remained the same. Feudal lords still fought each other for territory and power. Quite a long time passed before Italy finally found unity.\\r\\nThe first invention I want to take to this age is a camcorder. I enjoy filming, and also, I am greatly interested in the lifestyles and artworks during the renaissance age. It saddens me to see the masterpieces in museums, all worn down by age and war. I won’t be able to preserve all of these valuable works, nor will I be able to bring all of them back to the present. However, I will be able to store their image in a tape. Also, I would like to record how life was like back in the renaissance. Historians know already know a lot about the renaissance from the artifacts. However, very little is known about the exact lifestyle of the people. Little is known about how an ordinary peasant lived during this age. It is the same case for merchants, lords, knights, and the rest of the renaissance society. Filming the people using the camcorder will help us get a better grip of the renaissance age. I believe we, as well as future generations, have the right to know about our past. I believe the camcorder would prove to be very useful.\\r\\n\\tAnother invention I want to take is the vaccine for pest. Pest was a very serious epidemic during the renaissance age. Nearly 25million people, a quarter of Europe’s population at that time, died in just two years because of this disease. The society during the renaissance age was pandemonium. Everyone was caught in mass hysteria. Some people thought pest was God’s punishment, and donated all of their possessions to churches. Others even whipped themselves everyday to show God that they are making atonements for their sins. On the other hand, some people claimed that the end of the world was near, and spent their days enjoying everything that they could. Talismans and strange potions that were said to fend off the disease were extremely popular. Also, a lot of Jews were persecuted during this age. They were wrongfully accused to be the cause of pest. Priests claimed that these heathens were the cause of God’s wrath. Frightened people massacred Jews and took away their possessions. The disease caused serious economic breakdown, which only deepened the chaos. If I took the vaccine back to the renaissance age, I would be able to save most of these people. This would alleviate the economic setbacks. Also, by curing the sick, I would be able to stop the chaos. People won’t have to whip themselves, and no one would have to donate all of their money, nor buy ridiculous talismans. A lot of Jews would be saved from unjust accusation. The vaccine would stabilize the society, and help the renaissance prosper more than it did.\\r\\n\\tThere are many places in history that I would like to go back to. Also, there are many inventions that I want to take back to then. However, I believe that, with a camcorder and a vaccine, I would be able to help the renaissance age the most. The pest during that time was a terrible epidemic. By taking the vaccine, I would be able to prevent a lot of people from dying. Also, I would be able to mitigate the chaos that happened because of the disease. By taking the camcorder, I would be able to show future generations images of artworks that don’t exist anymore. Also, by filming the people, I would also help future generations get a better idea of how the renaissance was like. I would like to take these two inventions for these reasons.',\n",

Also, they can determine the student's confidence, his experience, and his viewpoints.\\r\\n  The question first askes the student to reflect on oneself and define what he is. It is very important for a person to look back at oneself. One can learn from one's mistakes, improve one's successes, and estabilish better viewpoints this way. After etermining what he is, the student has to look back into his life again and find what influenced him greatly. It can be anything; a school festival, a soccer match, or a painting in an art exhibition. However, this thing must be something that had a huge impact on how one thought and acted.\\r\\n  Until now, I have lived for only 16 short years. In this short period of time which I call 'life' I have experienced, learned, and influenced many things. I believe these are what helped me become what I am today. Having discussions with my friends had a great impact on what I am. Each of us had different viewpoints, lifestyles, and backgrounds. I was exposed to many different opinions, and this helped me shape my viewpoint in to something better. If I hadn't met my friends and discussed what we had discussed, experienced what we had experienced, and did what we had done, I would never have this intellect, this viewpoint, this body. \\r\\n  The question challenges a student to perform something that is perhaps man's greatest merit; retrospect. Without retrospect, humans won't be able to correct their flaws, adapt knowledge of the past into something useful for today, or teach future generations what they need to survive in this world. The question determines how much the student can contribute to society. If a person knows who he is, then he can help other people more effectively.\",\n",

       " (\"Terminally ill people often lose hope very quickly. Living suddenly becomes worthless, and they often ask the doctor or a family member to let him die. I don't think terminally ill people should be allowed to control their own death. Their death will effect their families, friends, and relatives a great deal. One's shouldn't be given the right to control one's death when so many people's lives are linked to it.\\r\\n   Every person has a family. Big or small, a family is tied together by a thick bond. When one member of the family  becomes critically ill, it effects the whole family. When the person is terminally ill, it becomes harder for the family to bear. Surely the family member's death would grieve the rest of the family a great deal. When so many people's hearts are involved, one should not act rashly about one's fate. However, it is very easy for a terminally ill person to do so. As I said, a terminally ill person loses all hopes of survival after he learns that he won't make it. The patient becomes severely depressed, and often feels the urge to kill oneself. Also, many patients feel that they are making their families waste their money on worthless hospital bills. If these patients were given the right to control their death, many woould act rashly.\\r\\n   A person's life, whether it is at its beginning or its end, is without doubt precious. One should not, even in the most desperate situations, treat life rashly. Many people are connected to the patient. Even though the patient's intentions might be good, his death would burden his family with grief that exceeds all others. Instead of trying to kill oneself, one should try to make the best out of the limited amount of time given to him.\",\n",

Also, his passionate and challenging characteristic and a good appeaerance enabled him to boost his brilliant careers as a young politician. In the late 1950s, when US economy was in a severe decline and people suffered from it, the candidate, Kennedy attaracted many people by promising economic revival under the name of \"New Frontier.\" This program convinced many people in the dark that the young man will help them to escape from poverty. So, Kennedy was elected as a youngest president in American history in 1960. However, when it was about the time he started his program, he was assassinated. By losing his life, his dreams for a wealthy and stable country was dissipated. Though the following president, Lyndon B. Johnson did his best to alleviate poverty, it is evaluated that he could not solve the virtual problem. It  took a long time to activate the dead economy since Kennedy\\'s death. Yes, he had a honorable reputation, wealthy family, and virtuous dream. But, Those got worthless once he died. \\r\\n      When I saw a movie \"Alive\", I realized how life is important once more.

When all food gets depleted, those hungry people decide an extreme way to survive. They decide to eat the flesh of the dead people around them. The dead might be their friends or family.

However, that was the beginning of many problems of the companity in the coming time. The affluent company began to expand its business fields. Under the name of diversificaion, it increased  the number of its succeeding companis up to 250. In the 1980, the growth of the company stopped and the stock prices of company declined rapidly. The company did need any action to stop it. The Guiness Company ,from that time, decided to demolish 150 of weak companies and to spend its all effort only on the production of black beer. They did not forget to develop global markets. The outcome was a big hit. After the company\\'s refurbishing, the sales began to increase and the stock prices went up by ten thousands. Now the Guiness company enjoys its fame as the best black beer producing company in the world.

Though African Americans were emancipated from slavery as a result of the civil war, thye still suffered from deeply rooted racism. Jim crow laws and many legitemate barriers  prevented African Americans from voting, using equal qualities of public facilities and getting equal educational opportunities. To gain their basic right, they started Civil Right movement which lasted for more than 20 years. Beginning with boycott of bus drive, African Americans criticized and tired to reform the unjust society. Not being afraid of death, they marched on and on. Many African Americans were killed during the movement. For example, to arrest the peaceful marches, the governor of Alabama, Eugene Connor, brutally killed many African Americans using tear gases, fire hoses , and electronic cattle prods.African Aemrican\\'s great leader Martin Luther King was assassinated. However, as a result of the loss of the precious lives, in 1965, they acquired voting right and laws which hindered their freedom were eventually ablished.

However, despite all these concerns, I believe that the media can control itself well because of \"observers\" of the media.\\r\\n \\r\\n     First, the media has many organizations which regulate preferability of contents in it. For example, when a new movie comes out, a committee determines a rate of movies in aspects of obscenity and violence. As a result, we can see the movies with \"R-rated\" or \"G-rated\" tag. This way helps children and teenagers receive refined information. Such constitutions can be found in making a newspaper, TV program, and so on. With sifting coarse contents which can be harmful to people, the media can regulate their potential danger to the public.\\r\\n \\r\\n    Second, there are millions of citizens who watch TV, listen to radio, and read the newspaper, and these people work as the police of the media. When the media mistakenly broadcast biased opinions, listeners or viewers protest improperness of a media\\'s report. Let\\'s take a instance. There is a TV program called \"Inside the TV.\" It shows viewers opinions about overall TV programs which has been broadcasted within a week. In the program, viewers point out problems of the TV shows, such as a wrong use of right words and a partial report. It shows that the cooperation between the media and people acts as a curb of the media.\\r\\n\\r\\n     In conclusion, newspapers or TV have an ability to control itself with the support of many formal groups and citizens. However, to achieve a complete adjustment, the harmony between these three axis is absolutely needed. The more these relationship is close, the more the media exert its potential power fully.

So this traffic problem is much more serious than Seoul in which there are a well-developed subway rails. As a result, when I want to go to a department store one kilometer apart from the house, I should assume that it will take more than 20 minutes to get there.

Sometimes, those who read only a plot overview and never even buy the novel take better score than students who read the novel thoroughly. As seen in this example,  Just one or two achievements resulted by the ordinary tests are not complete measurements of people\\'s ability.

With jobs ranging from registration, labeling and general maintenance, pesticides control have become very active since the early 1960\\'s. Influential government agencies, such as the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Pesticides Action Network (PANNA), and Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) have taken part in controlling the usage of pesticides\\r\\n[Environmental Protection Agency]\\r\\n\\tThe Environmental Protection Agency, also known as the EPA, is like the grandfather of pesticide control. As the first government agency ever involved in pesticide control, they regulate all pesticides used in the U.S. The EPA deals with the registration of newly invented pesticides, in which can get an official license only if they complete and pass 100 or more scientific studies to ensure its reliability. Their second important job is reviewing older pesticides, which may not correspond with current criteria (EPA). As science develops and environmental \\r\\nTak 2\\r\\nconcerns rise, people look for less dangerous, yet effective pesticides (Carson 98). Therefore, old pesticides that pose higher danger to humans or the environment are retested and possibly eliminated. In addition to their role of registration and review, the EPA also informs us about the reality of pesticides. They advertise that current pesticides are safer than those that have been in the past and that they have a firm grip on pesticides control to make people aware of their job (EPA). Also, through their publications and websites, they make people aware of the pros and cons of pesticides. The EPA has a special web page exclusively for kids that explain pesticide usages at a much easier and friendly level. In general, the EPA advertises, controls, and reviews pesticides. \\r\\nThey are very much aware that it can cause harm to the environment as well as the organisms living in it. However, since pesticides are essential for agriculture, they try their best to produce and maintain the most efficient pesticides. Their viewpoint toward pesticides is somewhat neutral, since pesticides are harmful, yet extremely essential. Still, the EPA is undoubtedly the most influential government agency that deals with pesticides in the U.S.\\r\\n[Pesticides Action Network North America]\\r\\n\\tAnother important agency is the Pesticides Action Network North America (PANNA). This particular group is slightly bigger than the EPA, in terms of the area they have control over. While EPA only deals with pesticides used within the U.S, PANNA deals with the entire North America. Another difference is their opposing viewpoint about pesticides. Unlike the EPA, that stands somewhat neutral in the usage of pesticides, PANNA is very negative about pesticides. This organization strongly feels that pesticides are destroying the environment and that only biological pesticides should be used. Biological pesticides are made naturally, without artificially mixing chemicals (PANNA). To promote further usage of biological pesticides and the unjustness \\r\\nTak 3\\r\\nof chemical pesticides, they continue to look for alternatives. PANNA encourages the natural food web, the process of eating and being eaten. Also, they try to defend basic rights of environment quality. This symbolizes that human interference should be reduced to its maximum capacity and that chemical pesticides should be eliminated to our best ability. \\r\\nIn order to control pesticides, PANNA is currently working on three major projects. The first project deals with pesticides and genetically engineered crops. They analyze pesticides to decrease harm caused to people. The second project co-operates with governments to find alternatives for chemical pesticides. They work with the EPA to challenge agencies that promote the usage of pesticides. The last project is the maintenance of pesticides. Their goal of this project is to stop people from relying too much on pesticides. Working on these 3 main projects, PANNA works to reduce the pesticide usage around the world.\\r\\n[Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development]\\r\\n\\tDo all countries regulate pesticides independently with different criteria and laws? No. The Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD) deals with the whole world\\'s pesticides control. However, OECD is not directly related in a sense that it was originally founded exclusively as an organization for wealthy countries. Their main job is to stimulate world trade and economy and they work toward achieving all countries\\' highest economic growth. A division of their work deals with environment and pesticides usage (OECD). \\r\\nThe OECD\\'s agricultural division is somewhat similar to America\\'s EPA, except that OECD deals with countries worldwide. They try to share methods of pesticides registration and re-licensing of old ones. All the countries registered in OECD gather together to discuss this issue annually or biennially. OECD\\'s next job is finding the agreeable standards for pesticides. Working as a group, they look for the lowest danger, and at the same time look for the highest \\r\\nTak 4\\r\\nquality that can be applied to the environment.

As either a strong point or a negative point, one of the Internet's characteristics is no limitation of knowledge. Surely, it makes people take information readily so provides unlimited source. However, it also gives people obscene information and it gives very bad effect on people. For example, a teenager, who has learned coarse language and watched violent movies on the Internet, is likely to become a gaudy person. Therefore, this information should be banned especially from teenagers.\\r\\n     \\r\\n     As well as raffish things, the Internet is becoming a main origin of groundless rumors. Because of anonymity on the Internet, users tend not to be responsible for their words and arguments. As a result, some people deliberately make a false rumor to damage one's reputation. For instance, there was a shocking event that a woman in her twenties sent a wrong fact that one famous entertainer died. This news broadcasted through the Internet and it was a real damage to the entertainer. There are no distinction between true and false information. We should control validity of information on the Internet.\\r\\n\\r\\n    In brief, it's true that formal supervision of content on the Internet is needed because of genuineness and preferability of files. Surely, one important reason why the Internet exists is freedom of expressing knowledge. However, current situation of the Internet is really primitive.

However, dramas often describe people with a low income as unhappy or unfortunate. \\r\\n\\r\\n     A street sweeper, for example, is often represented as a poor person. In the drama which describes the wandering of a poor person with hard works, a protagonist is a son of a street sweeper and the family is always described in despair and disappointment. However, in the drama, there is an assumption that poor people must be in despair and never hopeful. It's absolutely false. This situation can be true only in a dystopia, the worst world.\\r\\n\\r\\n     In conclusion, a underlying classification of the jobs are evident in dramas. TV should make a good example to the public. At least, it must not make a wrong trend in the society as seen in this example. Unbiased and discreet vision is needed to TV producers.\",\n",

Ignoring the purpose gun is meant to have, so many people abuse it and cause numberless crimes. The government must come up with stricter laws that can insure the safety of people from fear of gun. In my opinion, accessibility of gun for civillians can become very dangerous for two reasons.\\r\\n    When a person owns a gun, he/she should take a great responsibility. Gun is so easy and simple to use, but it can result in a detrimental injury. Many of the people who own guns do not know much about guns. Systemized education about the right usage of gun is required for everyone who owns gun. In particular, teenagers do not understand how dangerous gun is. There had been so many gun-firing incidents at schools in America. Students were shot to severe injuries and sometimes death. Parents were once and still are afraid and doubtful about their decision to send children to schools. When used without knowledge about it, unwanted accidents may occur.  \\r\\n    Gun is most likely to get obtained and used for bad purposes. Why and from when did people start to own guns for \"self-defense\"? The government legalized non-official citizens\\' possession of gun for them to protect themselves when they are in danger. Therefore, gun became available to people, even criminals. Since then, a countless number of crimes and gun-fights happened all around America. Although gun itself may have a just function, it is so tempting for people to abuse it.\\r\\n    When the government allows civillians to own guns, they always have to consider the potential risk. Sadly, there are people who seek to use developed technology for their advantage and for harming other if necessary. To get rid of even this small possibility of danger, gun should be prohibited.',\n",

Although the war itself is very malicious because it kills so many people and destroys buildings, lands, and environment, it can be justified afterwards if it prevented more lethal things from happening. The two World Wars are the best examples of this. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the World War I was eruped, the United States hesitated to enter the war. However when German U-boats consistently attacked on American merchant ships on overseas, violating the freedom of sea, and Germans threatened the Democratic nations, The US President Wilson decided to enter the war on the side of Allies. The war went favorably for the Allies and Democracy was saved from the threats of Germany. After the war, peace treaty was made to prevent any more wars afterwards, but the US Senate rejected the treaty, due to Wilson's blunder of being indifferet to Republicans. Since, the US, one of the most important nation, could not participate in the plan, other nations did not promote them strongly either, which led Germans to erupt another big war in the future.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough World War I was considered as a failure to many Americans, they learned from the past mistake; it was obviously shown in the WWII. The World War II came into the picture about 20 yeras after the WWI. The US was, again, reluctant to join the war but after the Japan's assault on Pearl Harbor, it entered the war against Axis power. The Allies won the war again, thus preventing the spread of totalitarian and monarch governemtns who tried to take over every possible lands mercilessly. Unlike a peace treaty after WWI, a treay after WWII was accepted by the American Congress. That treaty established things like United Nations, which successfully works to keep peace in the world even till now. American President Franklin Roosevelt learned from the mitakes of Wilson and he successfully carried out the policies after the war. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe war might seem very cruel since it takes so many people's lives and gives big damages to the nations who were involved in the war. However, if the war can prevent something worse from happening, it can justified, like the two World Wars. Both World War I and II prevented further aggression of countries like Germany and Japan.

Although it is really hard to choose one thing in particular, I would like to talk about the most recent experience that taught me one of the most valuable things in life.\\r\\n    It was only four or five months ago when I started wrestling. Compared to fall and spring seasons, I always did not enjoy winter season. It was a kind of sudden decision that I joined wrestling team. I have never wrestled in my life or was interested in wrestling. I still remember vividly the first practice of the wrestling season. It was completely different from what I have expected. I believe I have never felt so exhausted. So many kids gave up within the first week of practice. I really hated it too and thought about giving up about ten times a day. At the same time, I was shamed of the weakness in myself. Somehow, I managed to overcome physical fatigue by remaining mentally strong. I made myself trust that I would feel great after I go through what was infront of me at that time. \\r\\n    My resolution did not go that long. It probably happened after my third or fourth match. Although it is understandable because it was my first time wrestling, I did not really like to loose all the times. By this time, I got used to daily practices and started to really enjoy them. What bothered me the most was that I had to loose. My coach always encouraged me to keep working hard. Without help from my coach, I do not think that I could make it through the season. I really did my best during practices because I wanted to get better and win a match. By the end of the season, I improved so much and could win some matches. Those moments were the most fruitful and rewarding in my life. After the last game of the season, my coach told me to only think about how much effort I put in. He also said that one can be a true winner if he/she defeats his/her self. \\r\\n    Wrestling was truly an experience that I could not easily have.

Many opinions are presented by numerous experts and non-government organizations regarding safety of nuclear power and whether it is a promising energy source. Furthermore, major matters of concern on both sides are that of peril of accidents and the disposal of waste.\\r\\n\\r\\n  One of the seriously discussed issues is whether nuclear power is dangerous or not. Precisely, many feel the anxiety of unexpected incidents happening. Even though, a nuclear power plant is designed and constructed safely enough to endure sudden impulse, anything can happen. For example, in 1986, a nuclear power plant Chernobyl exploded leaving unforgettable damage. People lost their homes, while babies and cubs were born with deformities. Knowing all the risks people have to take, residents will oppose establishing nuclear power plants near them; therefore, it is not easy to find a proper place to set up. People are not willing to take any chances. Thus, the threat to lives and environments around the plants provoke disputes.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Secondly, the disposal of radioactive nuclear wastes is a big problem. The reason that it is hard to solve this problem is that there is no certain way to get rid of the leftovers. Currently, people bury and dump waste in the ocean. This is not a fundamental solution, and moreover, these methods pollute environments, affecting creatures living on Earth. Consequently, not having sure methods to remove wastes is another controversial issue to using nuclear power.\\r\\n\\r\\n  With no doubt, nuclear power is essential and is a more promising energy resource than those of fossil fuels which are major power supplies today. However, without resolving people's uneasy feeling of unpredictable mishaps and discarding radioactive wastes, the drawbacks to the use of nuclear power are inevitable. As sooner we find the compromise to the issues, we will have better solution for the future energy source.\",\n",

The history of African-Americans in the United States is the best example to prove this.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore the Civil War, African-Americans were enslaved in the United States. They were considered no more than a piece of property of whites. There were numerous slave revolts in many parts of the nation. Those uprisings might have shocked the white owners and gained some sympathy from very little number of whitse, but their effects did not last any longer than a week or two. Some of the effects even worked against the slaves; owners of slaves started to be more strict to the slaves. The violent actions taken by impatient slaves have affected the society for a very short period of time. However, abolitionists like Frederick Douglas worked to better the blacks' situations and abolish slavery in the nation. He did not take many radical actions but patiently worked to change the society completely, not just temporarily. He actively pursued more people to side with him as an abolitionist. \\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough the slavery was legally beganned in the nation after the Civil War, segregation of African Americans displeased blacks greatly. For centuries, they worked to end the segregation. Rather than violent actions, such as black riots in Chicago, nonviolent movements seeking gradual improvements of the segregation were successful. People like Martin Luther King Jr. believed in nonviolent  movements. Although they might had have wanted to see the segregation to end immediately, he correctly saw that it was impossible to end the segregation, which had prolonged in the US for hundreds of yeras, to end quickly. Thus, he worked to better the situation gradually with things like bus boycotts and March to Washing. \\r\\n\\r\\nPeople make  violent upheavals because they only see the short term effects. However, they should look further into the long terms and realize that the gradual improvements actually give more lasting social changes.\",\n",

Certain people do not need to take as much time as others to do things because they are smarter; they are usually called geniuses. Those geniuses tend not to work as hard because they trust their ability too much. The fact that some people are exceptionally smart by nature is no excuse for not giving their best effort because consistent effort is what makes people successful. The life of immigrants in the US and of Wang Lung in The Good Earth are best examples of this.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe US has been called the melting pot because so many immigrants came to the US and many of them settled permanently. Although many of those immigrants came with hardly any money and with small knowledge of American cultures, especially the language, they worked very hard to make there living and even prosper. For instance, Irish who came in big numbers in 1840s worked harder than other Americans. They did not have any or very little education and considered inferior by many Americans. Despite of all this plights, Irish did not give up but were willing to give their best efforts. They were willing to work for low paying jobs in factories. Although they had to work in very harsh conditions with very low pays, they consistently gave their best efforts. As time passed, the living conditions of Irish were getting better and some of them even prospered. Many other immigrants had experienced the similar life as Irish in the US. Even though the immigrants did not have intelligence or money to start with to be successful in the United States, they at last succeeded after giving a long steady effort.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn The Good Earth, its main character Wang Lung starts out his life with no intelligence and with very small property. Since he did not get any education, all he could do was farm on the little piece of land he had. Although his life seemed so miserable and hopeless, he decided to work really hard on his land. Thus, he started to work day and night. His work paid off. He started to store extra crops on the storage and sell them and make profits. With those profits, he bought lands from other farmers. Wang Lung’s lack of knowledge or small property did not stop him from giving his best efforts to better his life, and eventually became prosperous. \\r\\n\\r\\nOne may be very intelligent and are envied by many others. However, one should not use their intelligence as an excuse to be lazy in their work.

It\\'s also nothing special to us women have jobs such as a judge, a politician, a CEO, etc. But it has not been long, shorter than having right to vote, for women to get a high position jobs.\\r\\n\\r\\n   So it\\'s easy to think that  \"double standard\" doesn\\'t exist between the sexes anymore. But there still exist some. Let me tell you some of my experience. I am a 16 year old girl lives in Korea. Traditionally, Korea is a conservative country and there were a lot of discrimination and banning on women. Some of them are present in today\\'s Korea. When I was 7 years old, I sat on the carpet with my legs outstretched. At that time, my grandma saw me and scolded, \"What a terrible position you are sitting? How dare a GIRL sit outstretching legs like that? Put your legs together and sit modestly.\" Here is another story. When I was home, I used to sing pop songs loudly. One time, my grandma saw I sing in a very big voice, she called me and said. \"What a big noise you make! Jieun, listen. GIRL should speaks or sings quietly.\" I was very young and I didn\\'t have any idea about \"double standard.\" But I certainly remember that I felt really bad.

But some people disagree having anomals at home or zoos, because they think that animals are exploited by those actions. They feel pity for animals which reside with people.\\r\\n   \\r\\n   But I have a different idea. It is fairly clear that the majority of animals in zoos or home spend most of their time at leisure. Most animals in zoos are assigned no tasks except to came out of their cages to meet the spectators. Pets living home are also similar to zoos' animals, they greet and play with the owner than spectators. \\r\\n\\r\\n   But the situations of animals in wild is entirely different. There they are occupied almost 24hours trying to survive. They have three major tasks; to eat, to protect themselves from their enemies, and to find mates. In order to live, they must eat. This is not necessarily easy in the wild. It requires a great deal of time and effort in most cases. So leisure is rare in their lives.\\r\\n\\r\\n   Now, let us think again. Do we really explot animals when we have them as our lovely pets? Do we have to feel sorry for animals living in zoos? Of course, they may have some disadvantages. They have smaller erea to behave and act, they, sometimes, have to abandon their inherited habits. But they have much advantages as I stated above.

We can see examples in French Revolution, Gandhi's life, and aftermath of Iraq war.\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n The first example is French Revolution. In Louis 16's reign, France suffered from food deficiency, economy depression, and too much taxes. So, French succeeded in their Revolution, and made their country democracy. Although France's system changed, their civilians didn't change their ideology. In other words, they couldn't accustom themselves to sudden democracy. Therefore, they suffered in the reign of Jacob, and they instantly changed their system to imperialism by Napoleon.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n The second example is in Gandhi's life. He led the India's independent campaign, Satyagraha, nonviolent disobedience. And he tried to abolish invidious hierarchy, Caste, by teaching people. He believed that real independence in India resulted from people's enlightment. Therefore, without any violent upheaval, he accomplished India's independence.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n The last example is the aftermath of Iraq war. Before the war, Iraq was reigned by Sadam Husein. As he was dictator, he oppressed many groups in Iraq by his force. Therefore, Iraq was peaceful. But Iraquis were not prepared to enjoy democracy. After America's attack, many groups upheaval because the power to engross doesn't exist, and learned democracy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n  Seeing examples above, we can see that violent upheaval eventually needs gradual preparing, such as education.

If it happens continuousely, without restraint, the film makers and song writers may lose their will to make another products. That means we will not be able to enjoy those amusing, highly creative products of man. Think about the world there are no great movies, songs and novels. It\\'s even horrible to think.

Some people might say that our community need more places of industry and commerce. However I think that our town needs a place for cultural living. In my opinion what my hometown needs the most is more local culture centers.\\r\\n\\r\\n   Many people in our hometown have reached a stable financial status but many of them long for more chance to have cultural events and enjoyments. However when you take a look around our community all you can see is streets covered with after-school institutes and resturants and shops. If you want to go to a museum you have take the bus for at least 40minutes and to see a musical you have to take the subway for more than one hour. So because there are not much places here to get in touch with cultural life people's enjoyments in life is becomming more and more monotone. If there are some more local cultural center many people in my hometown will be able to enjoy more decent hobbies in their spare time.\\r\\n\\r\\n  In my hometown there are many teenagers who wants more fun and also should be given more chances to get in touch with many different and meaningful things. However as there are almost no cultural centers in our hometown only places teenagers go to is places such as internet cafe, board-game-cafe and shopping malls which may be fun but not very productive for their future. So if more cultural centers are built teenagers can enjot fun by ecentric museums, musicals and so on. In order to provide the teens with more meaningful and enjoyful places to spend time.\\r\\n  \\r\\n In conclusion I think my community needs culture centers for the benifits of the elderly citizens and the teenagers. As I live in my town sometimes I wish for so much things such as parks and theaters and so on. However all these are what the mayor can do so I think we should not complain about our societies but try to make little differences in them such as planting few small trees. Remember small changes can lead to great difference.\",\n",

Others say that they need to attain more general knowledge. However, I think the most important skill to success is the art of words because it helps people to interact with each other and show oneself to the world.\\r\\n\\r\\n Learning how to use words properly helps one to success by helping people interact with each other. In the globalized world like ours people need to co-operate with each other and to help that process using correct words are very important. If you can not speak politly conversation can not go on and yout without conversation we can not success. Few days ago, there as a club gethering at our school in order to clubs to help each other. At there the computer club and our club was talking about excahnging the computer and some books. Things weer going on fine untill the computer club started to speak rudely everyone got frustrated and the deal got canceled. Withou conversation nothing can be done and thus you can not achieve success.\\r\\n\\r\\n Mastering the art of words can become a helpful hand to express your self clearly. Nowadays there are so many people so it is nearly impossible for people to remember everyone. In order to success you give people clear image of yourself. If you can say a witty word or two people will be able to remember you from the many different competitors. Last december our school had a presidential election there were so many candidates but they all looked the same to us. However one candidate went around the school wearing a silly costume saying \"I will make our school were smile never disapears!\" and he was elected. There are so many competitors around us and a shocking word or two will deeply impress you in to people\\'s minds.\\r\\n\\r\\n In summary, to achieve success the most useful skill is the art of words because it helps people interact with each other and express themselves. I think sometimes a good phrase or so will be much more effective than hundreds of distracting movements.',\n",

       " (\"I do not believe that it is human nature to eat meat. Although it is definitely a fundamental part of the human being's structure to eat something, the kind of food one eats is not prescribed within the genes. Indeed, it is possible for one to go through the whole of one's life without feeling any carnivorous desires whatsoever.  It is, in fact, not a matter of nature, but a matter of training and habits.\\r\\n\\r\\nI can attest to this because I myself have been a vegetarian all my life. My mother has a natural aversion to meat; I have been cultivated to have an aversion to meat. And for both of us, having meat of any kind on the table makes us squeamish; to voluntarily put it down our throats would be unthinkable. And our bodies protest when our minds don't: if we happen to take a morsel (however small) of meat involuntarily, our bodies sprout all manner of rashes and other irritations. So it may even seem that our nature is (or has become) not to eat meat.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou may say that we are a peculiar lot- abnormal, hypochondriac-type people; but I'd rather say that we are a regular specimen of humans in which eating meat is not inherent. People like myself who have never tasted meat do not look upon animals as victuals; we simply lack that urge.\\r\\n\\r\\nI do not deny that people may have a certain predilection towards a certain kind of flavor, and that the flavor of meat may click in with their natural inclination. I believe that I myself might have made a great carnivore, had I been raised so. (Though we'll never know for sure, will we?) But as of now, meat has no appeal whatsoever for me.\\r\\n\\r\\nEating meat is no more a part of human nature than chewing nails is. It is all a matter of habits, of familiarization- if you are accustomed to eating it, very good; if you aren't, all the better.\",\n",

Unable to talk, hear or walk, he is at 12 years of age still a baby, and a very vulnerable one at that; and all his life he has been both the greatest joy and the deepest pain for all our family.

It would be against the very goal of the gun manufacturers themselves.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen a person manufactures a gun, their first priority is not to make it as safe as they can, but to make it as lethal as they can. After all, the purpose of a gun is to evoke harm or fear- without being so it could do neither, and neither would it sell. Therefore the manufacturers of small arms bend the most part of their concentration on how powerfully the machine can discharge a bullet, how smoothly the butt may fit into the user's hand so as to be the more effective; the matter of safety itself is pushed way back into the corner, if it is maintained at all.\\r\\n\\r\\nBesides the ulterior motive of the gun manufacturers (making weapons the more distructive in order to make the more money) which makes us deduce that they couldn't possibly do all they can to make their weapons safe, we also have plenty of empirical evidence which tell us that they are not. Each year we hear an appalling amount of accidents caused by guns setting off accidentally. While some of these accidents may be attributed to the carelessness or ignorance of the users themselves, we cannot deny that others are caused by deadly malfunctions in the machines, which might have been prevented had the manufacturers given more thought to safety.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt can easily be assumed that the  weapon industry, more than any other one, is full of competition; it can then also be assumed that the manufacturers would do more to make the weapons they produce effective than to make them safe. And sadly, the things we see on the evening news not unfrequently support this misgiving. Gun manufacturers are apparently not doing all they should to manufacture safe weapons; we can only hope that they will realize the other, highly ignored part that a gun can and should play in keeping its user safe- it's BEING safe.\",\n",

Sometimes we often met someone who did crime.  But someone feel not guilty , he or she acts what they influenced from movie or Tv. S0 we often see the headline of news, \\'\"The one man who tried to bahave just like main character of 000movies are escaped\"\\r\\n The second exaple of this idea is study way which recent parents use their young to learn about good thing on Tv or movies.\\r\\nOne scientist said that Tv and movies are easily to learn about what movies or Tv wants to say. So parents who have their young are used to watch good movie or tv show. Because young are eaily to understand and act what are needed. The young who had studied like that are creative, and active.

While I sympathize with the extreme pain some of these patients may have to endure, and recognize how heavy their hearts must be at the seemingly wasted economic burden they endow upon their relatives, I still believe that being lenient on assisted suicide would seriously impair the concept of human dignity.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the ethical sense, artificial euthanasia lowers the boundary between humans and animals dangerously. While some people staunchly affirm that animals have souls, not many of them have much objection to putting suffering beasts to rest- they regard it as an act of mercy. \\r\\n\\r\\nNow, can that same principal be applied to humans? I believe not. As long as we hold that there is something more to a patient than their suffering, that there is a pricelessness in their simply BEING, that, to the last, they hold something so sacred that it shouldn't be meddled with; as long as we hold any suspicion that these things are true, assisted suicide should be strictly prohibited.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen there is always the danger of a law, however good, being abused; and when that law concerns giving someone the right to take an innocent person's life, the danger becomes very real. A permit for assisted suicide, however strictly issued, would still be a permit for ASSITED SUICIDE, and in the wrong hands it could cause irrevocably damaging results. Failing to punish doctors who practice euthanasia would be fairly equivalent to giving them the right to murder.\\r\\n\\r\\nMan, not being a god, is apt to err, and an error in the matter of life and death would be fatal. If we wish to avoid formidable consequences, if we wish to retain the sense of human dignity, we would do wise to take every measure to prohibit artificial euphanasia.\",\n",

It is not easy to addresse one's ideas or thought. Because, most of all, talking is couse of interacting. One speak another listen, another speak one listen. But Tv, It is one sided. Tv just gives us something but we can give tv anything. And watching tv is active and moving, easy to follow, and box of media which consists of sound and view. We can just see without thinking.

I do not agree with those who support applying cloning technology to humans. It is not acceptable in many ways.\\r\\n\\r\\n  For one, it would bring much chaos considering one\\'s own identity. Just imagine having to accept the fact that there is another human being with the same  appearance, attitude, and even identical genetic codes. You certainly won\\'t feel too comfortable.

People will be confused to seek their own identity and confused to draw a definite answer to this simple question: \"Who am I?\" \\r\\n\\r\\n  Furthermore, people will start to feel and treat themselves as less important creatures. Deprived of their uniquness as an \"individual\", \"the one and only\", people will easily throw away that sense of self-respect and very soon, the entire human race would give up their vested superiority as human beings. This is a serious issue. People will treat others just as and even more carelessly then themselves and this will bring about serious increasement in crimes and moral distortion in our society.

If, through genetic testing, they are early exposed to genetic defects which they might otherwise have been oblivious of, this could cause seriously damaging results in their character development.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe early years of one's life play an immense role in what kind of a character one develops. If the testing were to produce no negative results, nothing would be better; but that, unfortunately, is not always the case. Were a child to realize that he or she had an inherent defect, the shock of that discovery could more severely harm them than any defect held in oblivion could. \\r\\n\\r\\nChildren are especially sensitive to being 'different'. And even if no outside anomaly is discernable,  the knowledge that he or she is different from other children could nag away at them, and seriously impair their confidence. Even if the knowledge were closely kept from the child, the fact would still remain, to possibly influence the way their parents or guardians regarded and treated them- things which would most likely be felt by the child.\\r\\n\\r\\nI once read a story in which a somewhat crippled boy ran a foot race against normal kids- simply because he didn't know he had a defect, and his parents never told him he couldn't run fast. I think this case may also be applied to children with genetic defects. If there is no black and white lettering to spell out that they are imperfect, they could grow up to develop tremendous potential, whereas if they know from their early years of their defect, they might unconsciously limit themselves most seriously.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf a child's genetic defect is not so serious that he or she is manifestly disabled, then I think it is better to let it remain unknown. No one's body is perfect, and people can live with a little quirk or two in the genes.

They encouraged me with the most sweetest words and literally showed their love just for me for who I was. I feel very lucky to have been born in this family where I could treat and be treated as a friend. A good friend.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Finally I thank my family for correcting me whenever I go the wrong way. Different from the previous characteristics of my family listed above, they are also able to guide me in the right way even if it means hurting my feelings a little. My parents in particular are very strict in terms of sticking to values like honesty, faithfulness and diligence. When they see me being dishonest, unfaithful or not doing my best, they can be very cold. They would not embrace me and accept my shortcomings so easilly. They try and succeed everytime in correcting and leading me in the right way.  \\r\\n\\r\\n  For all these reasons, I would say my family is one thing I would consider as the most valuable treasure in my life. They are my best friends, counselors, and my guides.\",\n",

       " ('In my opinion, the death penalty is more a means of exacting retribution for crimes already committed than a means of preventing them. If that is true, then the death penalty can hardly be expected to be efficient in preventing heinous crimes.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvidences support this belief that the death penalty is not an effective deterrent for crimes. In countries like France that have abolished the death penalty,  there has been no significant growth in crimes; nor has crime diminished in countries where the death penalty has been revived (i.e. United States).\\r\\n\\r\\nThat is not surprising when we consider the circumstances that lead to an extremely reprehensible act.\\r\\n\\r\\nGenerally, serious crimes may be divided into two categories- those that are premeditated, and those that are committed in the sheer frenzy of the moment. In the former case, the criminal will either think out all possible means of escaping being detected, or simply will not care if he or she is. And in the latter, in the blindness of passion the offender will have no time to brood over what might befall him in consequence of his or her actions. In neither cases does threat of death serve as a sufficient deterrent, as in most cases that which perpetuates the crime blinds one to all else, until it is too late.\\r\\n\\r\\nTherefore, I cannot agree that the death penalty is an effective measure of deterring heinous acts efficiently. In order to construct a healty, crime-free society, we should stop resorting to means which lean heavily on retribution, and instead focus on finding ones which effectively promote regeneration.',\n",

       " (\"Some countries in the world today, consider the death penalty as the best legal reaction to murderers. But I am against this opinion. Who gave a person the rights to kill another? How is that lawful? And what if that judgement was wrong? There would be no turning back. How will a dead man be repayed for his innocence?\\r\\n\\r\\n  Punishing a criminal who has been proven guilty of a murder by killing him would be a contradiction. Isn't it against the law for a man to kill another? That's the very reason why the convicted is on the trial. And just because it is clear that the convicted has committed a murder, it doesn't make it square to make him pay for it with his own life. Who gave us the rights to kill those who have killed? We are men also. We have no reasonable grounds to decided whether or not another man should live. There are plenty of other alternative punishments for a murderer. Those that are more appropriate and effective as a way of paying back to the society for what he has done. For example, living a life-long sentence doing socially beneficial activies like volunteering work. \\r\\n\\r\\n  Man are not perfect. Therefore, not all the judges and the members of the jury are without a mistake. How do we know; how can we be sure that all the courtcases were judged correctly?  What if an innocent was convicted as guilty and sentenced to death? There would be no turning back. There is no way for us to correct our mistakes. What's more there is no way for us to repay a dead man for his innocence. So, wouldn't it be better to spare the convicted of his life, in case of a mistake that might be found later on? What is more important than a man's life? It's true that it takes money to manage the prisoners, and it may mean the government has to give up some other plans it might have as a consequence. But I still think, that considering death penalty as the best protection from a murderer is wrong. \\r\\n\\r\\n  To conclude, it is both morally and logically unreasonable to choose the death penalty as the best legal reaction to a murder. Nobody has the right to kill another man no matter what the reason might be. And since no man is perfect, we must leave some room for ourselves just in case we make a mistake in convicting a murder, because life, whether it be a murderers or not, is the most important thing we should value.\",\n",

       " ('I accidently chose the wrong topic for my essay...\\r\\nIt would be nice if I could be judged on this new topic:\\r\\n\\r\\nShould cigarettes be made illegal? Why or why not?\\r\\n\\r\\n  Millions of people in the world smoke today. Even though it is crystal clear that cigarettes are harmful and everybody agrees with it, the number of mokers in the world is constantly increasing. Now, I see two big points against making cigarettes illegal. \\r\\n\\r\\n   First, I believe every adult  has the right to smoke; just as much as one has the right not to smoke. It should be left to his or her free will. If one is financially capable and is willing to smoke, despite all the health risks,  than we should repect their decision. I am not very fond of cigarettes myself, but I have heard many people complaining about the unfair treatments they receive in their work places. In Korea, during the past couple of years, with the World Cup and all, the government started numerous anti-smoking campaigns throughout the country. As a result, many people in general became to have a negative perspective towards the smokers. With most company buildings being declared as non-smoking areas without any special facilities for the smokers, they were put under enormous pressure socially.  They said they feel like \"outsiders\" in the society. Of course it was not illegal to smoke in our country but it was literally made almost impossible because of the overall mood of the society. Simillarly, if cigarettes are made illegal, it would be restricting people\\'s rights to smoke. We can make several restrictions to protect those non-smokers from the harmfulness of the cigarettes but it is not reasonable to ban cigarettes altogether.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Another reason why it is unreasonable to make cigarretes illegal is the fact that it will only make more crimes and disturb the social tranquility. Cigarettes are strongly addictive, and almost all smokers admit that they are addicted to them. Now, if we ban the cigarettes by making them illegal, it is not very likely that the smokers will quit smoking instantly. Just like other illegal drugs, cigarettes will be sold underground by much higher prices. This in turn makes all smokers outlaws. And because the activity itself is so secrete it can lead to more serious crimes which will end up leading our society into a big turmoil. What could have been a nice hobby can in an instant be labled as a major crime. And those who have been smoking for quite a while now, will not be able to stop and eventually be considered as a much lower person in our society. This is not a good picture. \\r\\n\\r\\n  Therefore I strongly disagree, even though I dislike smoking myself, against making cigarettes illegal.',\n",

Many people say that 8 hour is not too long or not too short. But in my opinion, 8 hour is very long to work with concentration. To work with concentration is more important than to work with long hours. Many workers and careers want to shorten working time, because 8 hour is too long and worker can work within 8 hours. \\r\\n\\r\\n     Second factor which satisfy a job is  friendly relationship between the boss and the careers.\\r\\nThe boss is head of the his company, so he or she try to order the career. So many careers are just following boss's commands. But I think that if the boss and the career have a great relationship , to work is very easy for careers. Because the problems that careers meet are discussed by the boss and the careers,so many good points come and they try to proceed works together. So many careers feel that working is not that hard. \\r\\n\\r\\n      Third factor which satisfy a job is a lot of money for whom did a great job.\\r\\nIn these days, money is very important to live.

It simply lacks the power to address issues of new technology.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe live in an age where people of every country in the world have access to the internet. Each user of the internet has the power to put their marks upon it, and almost all do so. Each bit of information one produces is highly liable to be reproduced elsewhere without the original author knowing it, and to even attempt to keep track of all the ramifications sprouting from the original source would not only be impractical, it would be foolish. \\r\\n\\r\\nBefore the internet era, circumstances in which information was conceived were very different from the present. Sources of information people had access to were highly limited, and the information they themselves conceived was also limited in access, only available in the form of books, manuscripts, and such. In effect, the individual pieces of information these people published were able to have quite an impact on their field of interest, while just such a field had limited influence on people as a whole.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhich is not so now. Today we live in a vast ocean of information, where each individual bit of information is linked to trillions of others, creating a complex network of information. And while the value of separate pieces of information has decreased, the value of those pieces linked together to form a corporate whole has increased thousanfold. Thus it is that the creators and collectors of information, together with other creators and collectors of information, are able to influence vast numbers of peoples, while individually their influence may be but puny. And in turn they themselves are contiguously influenced and reshaped by the information they have interacted with in the process of producing information. Thus, the point at issue in the digital world today  is not necessarily who produces the information, but how it is corporated into the unending stream of just such information, as to contribute to the creation of new information. In this context, the application of traditional copyright laws to digital media would be meaningless.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn conclusion, I think that it would be both impractical and impolitic to apply traditional copyright law to mass media. With new technology come new values, and I think that in the digital world we now live in, the wisest thing would be to make use of the interactive attributes of the internet to produce the most synergic effects.\",\n",

Yet, in spite of this abundance of prisons we still have crime everywhere. Which leads us to wonder, Do prisons reduce crime?\\r\\n\\r\\nDo prisons reduce crime? That is a very difficult problem to answer straighthand, so let us consider how the world would be without prisons. Prisons have risen out of the necessity of man to find some means of prohibiting felons from doing wrong without virtually exterminating them. And along with restricting criminals for a certain period from committing other crimes, they also serve the double purpose of restricting regular people, like us,  from future crimes. For man seems to have a strange fear of being confined physically.\\r\\n\\r\\nWithout prisons, what else could man rely on to restrict crime? One's conscience? Man is only too apt to err. Fines, exorbitant ones, maybe? Perhaps, but not likely. Death? For embezzlements? Pshaw.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the idea of human beings confining other human beings does seem rather obnoxious, I still think that prisons are a necessary evil, and that they DO help reduce crime.

But I believe there are some things that my attract me away from the television. \\r\\n\\r\\n  I usually want to watch TV when I have nothing to do in particular. For example, I find myself looking for the remote control after I had finished my homework or the house chores. Nothing else comes into my head faster. But when I think about it, I do have other interests and hobbies. I like going out with my friends, whether it be kicking a soccer ball or going eye-shopping to the nearby shopping center. I love going to the movies, or listening to my favorite CD's. I have a lot of board games in the house too. Maybe, if I just turn my head a little and look for these other entertainments, I might be able to give up TV. \\r\\n\\r\\n  But I must admit that I prefer switching on the television with cold glass of orage juice lying on my comfortable armchair. I should look for more exciting activities, like joining a sports club in the weekends or making a study group with my friends. Imply some sort of responsibility to my hobbies. The sports club will have regular practices and the study group must have meetings every few days. This sense of obligation will draw my attention and eventually enable me to give up television totally. Keeping my mind busy on something else, and not allowing myself any time to even think about turning it on, might do the trick. \\r\\n\\r\\n  Spending more time with my family will also help. Having family discussions or even a casual chat after diner can prevent the TV from being turned on.

I would like to explain this in two different perspectives.\\r\\n\\r\\n  For one, we can easilly see examples of this in our everyday life. At school for example, we had the athletics carnival last month. It is our school's tradition to wear a class-uniform. So every year we had to discuss which T-shirt we were going to wear as our class-uniform. And every time, even though we held many class meetings to decide, it ended up  listening to those few strong boys who had the loudest voices and big muscles. Most of us didn't like the design. But nobody dared to make an argument with the decision. And schools are supposed to set the examples of democracy to us young students. Even the teachers are the same. No matter how strong we protested against going on our picnic on Monday (the weathercast said it would rain on Monday), the principal and the teachers didn't listen. We as students don't have any legal strength to disobey the teachers' decisions. We went on our picnic on Monday, which of course rained as forecasted weeks before. \\r\\n\\r\\n  In a much bigger perspective, we can also witnesses the strong always having their ways in the politics. The few leading countries in the world make most of the decisions and the weaker ones must follow. They are not legally bound to follow any orders but in reality they are under a lot of pressure. Take the iraqi war for example. The U.S government is demanding many other coutries to send troops to fight in Iraq. But the international mood is not so great, many countries not agreeing with the departure of their soldiers to Iraq. Korea for example, is under a lot of pressure. The Korean economy is not so great and the politics is also just beginning to settle down after the big turmoil concerning the president's impeachment. But the U.S is relentlessly demanding the sending of the troops. \\r\\n\\r\\n  To conclude, I believe the strong is still doing what they wish and the weaker ones have no choice but to follow their decisions, whether it be in politics or our everyday life.\",\n",

Currently there is no law prohibiting one from making such a decision but come to think of it, it is nopt right morally. Same with suicide, killing oneself does not bring a bright feeling to anyone. Especially when one is sick, he is not mentally fit to make a healthy decision. Everybody with a common sense and self-conscience will realize it is not a rightful thing for a human being to commit. Man has the right to be free in his actions but that freedom should be restricted to the boundaries of others' rights. People don't live by themselves. Human beings are social animals by nature. Hurting oneself does not end at his own concerns. For example, the family and friends are there to help you in times of need and give you advice when having a hard time. They care about you and try to share that hurt and sorrow with you. To those precious people, you are doing them wrong by deciding to kill yourself, no matter what your current satus is. If you are an important personnel in your society or group, the impact is much larger. Say you are a father of a family, a teacher of a class, or a president of a country. Your single personal decision will lead up to the entire group's turmoil. It will be a selfish decision. \\r\\n\\r\\n  To conclude, I strongly disprove with the idea that terminally ill people should have the right to control their death.

The media of countries under dictatorship are controlled by the government, while those of democratic countries are heavily influenced by the individual interests of the broadcasting networks. Hence, the news one receives is highly vulnerable to bias or to outright distortion of the truth, thus lacking in the objectivity that should be the foremost responsibility of the media in presenting news. The infamous cover-up of the Gwang-ju Crisis in Korea and the highly biased news during campaign season support this view that the media is irresponsible.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the military dictatorship of Korean president Jun Doo-hwan, protestors, mainly composed of college students, took to the streets of the city of Gwang-ju. The military was quickly sent to quell the riot, and by direct presidential order an appalling massacre of the citizens ensued, in which even mothers nursing their babies were shot down on the spot. Yet half a decade had to pass before the rest of Korea found out what atrocities had taken place. The media, wholly under the control of the government, not only failed to report the event accurently, but even went further to depict the murdered citizens as highly dangerous criminals. \\r\\n\\r\\nAnother example, though not so graphic, also indicates that the media is apt to be biased. In Korea there are three major broadcasting networks, two of which the government has the right to pick the chief executives of. Thus, each time a leftist or rightist administration sets in, the news is influenced accordingly. This phenomenon is especially clear during campaign season. The generally theme of the newscast is often adjusted to promote a favorable impression towards a certain party, and the speeches given by opposite party members are frequently edited so as to give the viewers a highly negative impression. For example, \"Unlike you, I don\\'t condemn people for being uneducated\" becomes \"You... are uneducated.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe foremost responsibility of the media in presenting news is to present it accurately and objectively. Sadly, a lot of times the media fails in exactly that, which in time makes one highly skeptical of the media.

The way the Australian kids thought and the things in which they took great values didn\\'t interest me at all. Like a deaf and speechless, I spent my years in primary school.

No one contests that cigarettes cause lung cancer and other fatal diseases. And it is now an established fact that first-hand smokers expose those nearest to them to equally deadly diseases. Studies show that more deaths occur annually from cigarette-induced diseases than from car accidents.

The situation of the food market in Korea, which lacks a centralized substance-testing organization, illustrates this view.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Korea, where the influence of the FDA is yet meager, it is extremely hard to discern between food that's safe and food that isn't. Cheap ingredients from China are brought across the border and passed off as Korean ingredients, thus selling at a much higher price than their original worth. And as ingredients from China tend to be highly contaminated (vast amounts of lead have been discovered in fish shipped from China), consumers are cheated not only of their money, but also of their health.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat is why my mother only uses Morton's salt. Wiith Morton's, she knows exactly what quality to expect, while with Korean salt, one can't even be sure if it IS Korean.

That may seem inconsequential on a small scale, but if it becomes a pattern of society, the economical consequences could be great.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe FDA approval process is definitely a big asset to a society devoted to its consumers.

I was still not fluent in my speaking and felt uneasy when asked a question by may school teachers. But two years past, and finally some improvement did show. I was able to feel more comfortable speaking in English that in Korean. And now, in my third year back in Korea, I am still able to use my English just as fluently as before. But I saw manyh of my Korean friends who visited Australia during the holidays or the long summer vacation. Why? To learn English. I told them it will not be easy, but they didn\\'t listen. I meet some fo those friends still, and they can\\'t speak English at all. I think anything gradual works, because it lasts. \\r\\n\\r\\n  Same goes for anything else. Even when a government wishes to enforce a new system, it should be gradual. Anything too sudden wil arouse disagreement from the people and that system won\\'t be supported by the citizens. But to slow changes, they will listen because they are able to understand it more fully and and not get the feeling they are getting overpowered by the government. The people will eventually come to agree with the systems main purpose. And with time, it gives us chance to think over about the campaign and prevent errors that might occur when rushed. It will make the project more sturdy and solid with less mistakes. For example in Korea, the ecnonmy was at its worst in history about 5years ago. At that time our new president pomised to solve that problem through his campaigns. But he was too quick. He rushed it. As a result, now five years later, we are facing even a worse slump in economy.\\r\\n\\r\\n  To conclude, for these two reasons, I agree with Alexander Pushkins words, \" the most lasting social changes are those that result from gradual improvements\".',\n",

       " ('To envy someone may be a good thing and a bad thing. It has both the positive and the negative points. But I think it has more benefcial effects. \\r\\n\\r\\n  First, when you envy someone, you automatically set for youself a goal-a destination. That very person you envy becomes your idol and someone you desperately want to be like. To borrow Edward Arlington Robinson\\'s words, he makes us \"wish that we were in his place\". I have had a personal experience which supports this statement. In my middle school years, I knew a friend who seemed just perfect. He was handsome, tall and was blonde. He was smart and always got top grades in all exams. He was the captain of the school\\'s soccer team, in which I was a reserve. His manners were also perfect and that was enough to attract all the pretty girls in our school. He had everything I longed for. He was an ideal personnel I had always dreamt of. He was my final destination. I wanted to be like him so much that I began copying his every move. I even followed his haristyle, ate what he ate for lunch and studied the subjects he studied after school. Slowly but eventually I was more or less becoming to be like him.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Envying someone does have some negative effects as well. It proves that you are not perfect, that you are still behind someone and that you must surpass him to be the \"best\". It might get rid of any  self-gratitude you might have foriyourself and you may feel somewhat unhappy about the way you are. But if you can manage all that rubbish, then it can help you stay alert and focused on developing yourself to be a even better person. To contunue improving yourself. I thought I was a nice guy before I met that perfect friend. But he changed my standards of judging what\\'s \"perfect\". \\r\\n\\r\\n  In otherwords, I agree with the argument that envying someone serves as a strong motivating force for some people to improve their condition and place in life.',\n",

       " ('Conflicts between generations can be a very hot issue. But I believe it is not only inevitable but also necessary because it leads to productive changes. Here are some examples.\\r\\n  There have always been differences and conflicts between two generations in any human society. But I think, if both sides just give in a little bit and allow each other to calmly explain their situations, that \"generation gap\" can be resolved. It can give them opportunities to learn and acknowledge each other. To accept their differences and respect each other\\'s values. The younger generations lack experience and knowledge, which they can learn from the former generations. In return, the elders can start learning and adjust to the new trends. Many adults these days don\\'t have the adaptability to learn new skills that youngsters so quickly understand computers for example. The kids learn fast, playing games and surfing the internet. But the adults take much longer time to learn the same skills. At first, these differences may cause some minor conflicts but if they have the right attitude to try, both generations can cooperate to develop together as a whole-as a complete community.\\r\\n  To give a personal example, I had many fights with my parents over my hairstyle and the fashion of my clothing. When I was a couple of years younger, I had a strong will to imitate pop stars that looked gorgeous on television. I wanted to do my hair just the way they did theirs. When I went shopping, I always looked for the same brand of clothings which were much too expensive for my parents to afford. But now when I look back, I think that was the time when I had the longest conversations with my parents over a single subject. During that time I was able to understand what my parents wanted from me and I was able to accept their suggestions.\\r\\n  To conclude, I agree with the assertion that in the long run, conflict between the generations is a positive, rather than a negative, force for change.',\n",

Which sounds morally correct, but I think there are situations in which that view is uncorrect. One circumstance is in which outside invaders threaten to take, or have taken, peoples' rights to govern themselves; the other is when the consequences of not going to war would be brutal, ongoing human suffering. \\r\\nTake World War II, for example. When Hitler invaded Poland and went on to attack other countries, the rest of Europe resisted because they, naturally, did not wish to be under foreign dominion. They knew that under German rule, the conquored would not enjoy the same status as the conquorers; plus, former citizens of conquored countries would become highly susceptible to injustices, yet retain no power to keep those injustices from happening. Thus, their war was justified because they were fighting for their liberty.\\r\\nBut Hitler did more than just invade other countries. What made him really infamous was his persecution of Jews, Gypsies, and other ethnical minorities he termed 'inferior'. The atrocities at Auschbitz and other concentration camps are well known- the 'weak' were killed at gas chambers, and the relatively strong were, literally, worked to death. In short, the Jewish population was decimated. Had Hitler been left to do what he wanted, he would not have stopped until he wiped the Jewish out entirely. Was the world to stand by and watch while he did that? No; and thus was the war on the side of the allies justified- it brought to a stop the hideous persecution of the Jews.\\r\\nWar involves bloodshed- in many times, very much senseless bloodshed. But I still believe there are things worth shedding blood for, such as liberty and the release of inhuman bondage.\",\n",

However, his fame did not bring only bright outcomes. His parents divorced because of problem involving the division of their little son\\'s earning leaving the boy alone.

Like a chain, When he fought with someone, another approached him as though he had been awaited. I suggested trasferring to another school.

In other words, even though censoring information on the Web may be considered a violation of a person’s free will, the pejorative effects of those vulgar web contents outweigh the advantages of the Internet. People, especially teenagers, are unlikely to have persistent self-control and thus are prone to access inappropriate web contents. However, this censorship should be implemented only with the consent of an individual.\\r\\n\\r\\n     Numerous misdeeds occurring today are the ramifications of indiscriminate information the web provides: suicide pact, mob violence, group bullying, multiple murder and many more. People with concurrent ideas on a specific subject or those having pessimistic views of the world gather on-line and form factions. In extreme cases, those groups meet offline and perform collective actions. \\r\\n\\r\\n     Less mitigating than ruthless collective behaviors but nevertheless a grave issue is the exposition of sensual materials to adolescents. Being both physically and mentally immature, they are deeply affected by vulgar content on the Internet and have the propensity to emulate certain behaviors. Since they have stealthy curiosity of the life of the grown-up, teenagers are unable to set limits on their own actions. \\r\\n\\r\\n     Censorship disrupts the freedom to know and the freedom of choice. An individual has the right to choose the kinds of materials he wishes to see and neglecting it is therefore an invasion. Hence, providing that an individual has agreed to filter content on the Internet, censorship would no longer be an offensive act. In the case of a teenager, this decision-making is supposedly shifted to a parent or an equivalent, responsible for the young. \\r\\n\\r\\n     In short, the Internet provides arbitrary content that is freely accessible and the outcome of this can be very damaging. Precisely for a teenager, there needs to be some type of forceful boundaries as prevention of potential detrimental consequences.

Optimism does not merely pertain to extreme cases like the accident.  It helps us even in petty struggles of our everday life and acts as an energizer to us.\",\n",

And  proportional to the rate of the increasing number of guns being carried, the rate of gun accidents and murders are also increasing. Looking at this fact, it is hard to think that age limits are not needed. Here are a few reasons why age limits are important.\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst of all, guns are not toys that can be used by all generations. It is a object  which was meant to harm other things. Some people think that if they use it carefully, they can use it for good a purpose like defending themselves or others. But the hard fact is, you can never be too careful. If it is safe, why would there be so many gun accidents.\\r\\n\\r\\nSecondly, the truth is, even adults make mistakes and misuse a gun. If a fully educated and grown adult makes a mistake, there is a lot of chances a 10 year old might certainly will. So to keep children away from guns as much as possible, age limits would be crucial.\\r\\n\\r\\nToday, guns are usually used to protect yourself our your family. But that dosen't change the fact that it is a dangerous weapon and can be used in bad purposes or misused and cause an accident. But accidents can be prevented by complementary measures and making a age limit is definitely one of them.\",\n",

Such qualities do vary from person to person, but they are oftentimes universal rather than unique. And in my case, the one thing that was especially valuable was trust in oneself. \\r\\n     During my freshman year in high school I played basketball. Not only it is a sports that require physical prowess, but it is also one that demands a firm and ready mind. Unlike other coaches who put great emphasis on tactics, my basketball coach always reminded us to trust in oneself. This advise may look simple if not unnecessary, but as a player I realized that this was the one filled with charm and magic. As a freshman, other teammembers or I often collapsed after making one little mistake, and it was not unusual in the beginning of the year for a freshman to do his very worst in a game because he lost his self-confidence. Our coach's advise never failed to cheer us up when we most desperately needed one. \\r\\n     I believe that the exact same thing applied outside of the court. The advise I learned from my basketball coach, to trust in oneself, was not limited to only basketball or even sports, but in every day-to-day activity. It was not long before I realized that greater confidence in myself bore better results whatever I do. And the positive results in turn boosted my self-confidence. \\r\\n     In life, I have learned many essential qualities, but the best one is still my coach's advise, to trust  oneself.  Without these magic spell I would have been a much lesser man today. That is why the quality of trusting in oneself is the one I cherish the most.\",\n",

As a result, some people choose euthanasia as a way to die with dignity. However, euthanasia is not the only way and, on the other hand, a request for euthanasia is not a request for ending a life, but a request for more care and life. THerefore, patient\\'s own decision on euthanasia cannot be justified.\\r\\n\\r\\n   Euthanasia literally means \" good death.\" This misnomer sometiems confuses many patients leading them to consider euthanasia as the only way to die with dignity. THose patients\\' conscience is wrong and the act of killing is wrong. If the unbearable pain is the reason, doctors\\' palliative prescription may help. THe purpose of prescribing painkilling medicine must be to relieve the pain, not to hasten the death. If even those medicine cannot help the patients, they should be aware that the death cannot be prevented. Accepting the death as natural, but not giving up the life is the most dignified way of dying. \\r\\n\\r\\n   In addition, people should be well aware the true intention of patients\\' asking euthanasia. When gravely ill persons ask to die, it should not be presumed that that is what they truly want. The request  to die may be an appeal for more help, love from family, friends, and caregivers. Loving assurance can help them understand how much they are cherished. Having patients understand how a life is important to give up might help them, too. \\r\\n\\r\\n   Aging and disabilities are feared as burdensome fates worse than the death. However, Christoper Reeve, the Superman hero who became paralyzed from neck down after a fall from his horse, has shown that losing physical ability does not mean losing personal dignity and meaningful life. As I mentioned previously, people have right not to suffer needlessly and to be helped to die with dignity. But no one has any right to kill oneself, Therefore, euthanasia by any one\\'s will is not morally acceptable.

       " ('There is an old Korean saying about success. It says “Don’t expect the fruit to fall right in to your mouth” Some people believe that in order to succeed we need luck. However, I think hard effort is much more important in achieving success because hard work can change a chance in to what others call luck and also as success is something gradual, steady work will eventually lead to a success.\\r\\n\\tFirst, I think endless effort is what really decides one’s success because unceasing effort eventually changes a chance in to what may be called luck. If one makes hard efforts to improve they will be able to grab a chance and turn it in to a chance. When I first entered middle school students with high grades were the only ones who gained attention from the others. I was not the best girl in our class or even near there. However, I wanted to be special so I studied English. Few months later there was an English competition at our school, nobody expected me to win but I won the first prize from grade one. If I did not work hard to be someone I could not have won that prize. So endless effort is what helps the most in one’s success.\\r\\n\\tSecond, people can achieve success through an endless effort because steady growth will eventually lead to a success. Rome was not built in a day; success is not something that happens over night. Steady and ceaseless effort is what builds up success. ‘Wang’s pancake’ is a famous franchised fast food company in Korea. Many people might think that Mr. Wang started with a lot of money or was just lucky. However, Mr. and Ms. Wang started as a little street shop they worked hard to earn more money and thought of many brilliant ideas, their success nowadays is the fruit of their hard work. Success is not the result of a radical unexpected luck but estimated and expected work.\\r\\n\\tIn summary, success is the result of one’s hard work because if we work hard we can grab potential lucks and hard work is what builds up a success. Many people tend to think that success is something far away from us. However, I think success is something that is somewhere hidden near us waiting for us to slowly approach it, no leap towards it.',\n",

Also, shops will be built near the factory to meet the demands of the workers so the community's industry will thrive. On the other hand, if a factory is built near our society the traffic and pollution will increase. More cars will pass our streets to supply the materials for the factory and as the factory produces products it will emit toxic hazards.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Despite all the advantages I and against building a factory in our town because of two major reasons.  First, the traffic will increase. If the traffic increases most of the people in our society who already have jobs out of our town will need suffer from terrible traffic jam every day.Even worse with more traffic laod more road accidents will happen. In a town called Bu-peung, where a industrial area locates, there are car accidents every day because of the over crowded roads. Second, the increase of the pollution will harm the residents health badly. In Busan, a famous port in Korea, there are many people who suffer from air pollution.

After finishing unhappy-middle school life, I went to highly competitive junior college. This time, I could not do well either because everyone was so bright. I could understand the phrase, \\'teach him one thing, he will learn ten other things.\\' This time, I was not discouraged at all. I somehow knew that I would manage to survive as I did in my middle school. Then I finally realized that I learned \\'self-confidence\\' during my harsh middle school life.\\r\\n\\r\\nFurthermore, my middle school experience helped me understand people around me better. When I was one of the top students in my school, I could not understand the reason why some students get bad grades and teachers scold them constantly. However, after experiencing it myself, I began to understand those students. Although I never thought that I can gain anything from my worst memories of middle school life, I learned something valuable after all.\\r\\n\\r\\nEven in their most troubled moments, people can still gain something. I never thought that I could gain anything out of my middle school life but I learned very important things after all. Therefore, before cursing, people should remember that \\'every cloud has a silver lining\\'.',\n",

An awareness of the eccentric position of the sky and of the ragged and bumpy road that made Shagal cry out an amusing remark, “We’re stepping the sky, breaking the law of gravity. Sorry Mr. Newton.” Yes, that snowing New Year’s Day started out with a catastrophic flip over, ironically on a day supposed to be filled with peace and prosperity. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe digital clock indicated the earliness of the day. The sun could be seen at the far horizon and a beam of light was slowly mounting the summit of the Rockies. All the world was covered in white except the parallel tire tracks that appeared as the car was advancing. Florence was contemplating the beautiful scenery, her nose flattened on the window. For once she was not talking, and for once we could enjoy the trip in total silence. Shagal noted that the wipers were moving to the rhythm, and I craned my neck over the seat to verify it, glad to have found something that could keep me awake. I reluctantly had to sit back and close my eyes, for the sun now gushed out its glowing rays. \\r\\n\\r\\nMusic now stopped, and instead came out a monotone mechanical voice, “Six o’clock. Happy New Year to all traveling. The condition of the road has worsened since it had frozen hard last night. Already five accidents have been reported….. Be sure to fasten your tire chain.” I heard a mutter of discontent and noticed Florence grimacing over the reflecting window. “Hey Pat, why don’t we stop to put the chains?” “Nah, no need to. See the rising sun? The road will melt in any second,” said Patrick.  He then squinted in search of a signboard, stooping his body a little. As expected, Florence began to chatter and grumbled out her concerns for safety. \\r\\n\\r\\n I forced myself to sleep and fell into a short doze, sickened by her high-pitched, vexed tone, only to be aroused by her piercing scream followed by a roaring bang on the head, so thunderous and shocking as if to decorate the accident with splendor. Something was wrong. My heart began to beat violently and a visible shudder swept over me. I regretted not having bought any insurance. As the car inclined to the left, Florence leaned over me and my knees struck against the metal door - don’t shout into my ears, please. Then the car deviated from the road, made path to a precipice, took a leap and drifted in the air, flipped over and came to a halt. The morning mist was rapidly turning into a thick fog. Weird. The car windows were smashed to shivers but the radio, undamaged, still emitted its melody. \\r\\n\\r\\nShagal twisted his body and asked, “Are you guys OK?” Apart from my arms scratched by the broken glass fragments, I was OK. Each time Patrick moved his head, he let out a moan. “Aouch! Yeah, I’m fine. God, that was something!” He spoke with a slight quiver in his voice and mangled the swollen airbag before him. Florence rose her head that was pressed against my aching shoulder, and went on babbling. Oh dear. And at last the music died away. \\r\\n\\r\\nDrrrrr. I groped my way out of bed and headed for the door, rubbing my eyes. I turned the knob and the door burst open. Standing tall, Shagal pointed at the parked car behind him with his thumb, and I lifted both of my palms - my sign that I would be ready in ten minutes. As I closed the door, my hair still wet, I thought, ‘A deja-vu?’ I locked the door and wavered to people waiting and shouted, “I’m coming!”',\n",

Characters necessary for being a good leaders is different from those needed for an ordinary person.  The definition of 'good' characters thus vary according to the social status and the period in which they belong.  This is shown in the example of GenGiskan, a renowned Mongol leader, in the novel 'To Kill a Mockingbird,' and in contemporary presidents of each country.\\r\\n\\r\\nGenGiskan, a Mongol warrior, is portrayed in historical records as a ruthless, venomous and unforgiving leader.  To his enemy, he was considered a tyrant but to his people he was one of the most laudable leaders in the history of Mongol.  He was revered as a good leader because his courage, his perceptiveness and his arbitrating qualities had brought much benefit for the country of Mongol.  The period he lived is marked by ceaseless wars for land.  GenGiskan has applied his power, his remarkable qualities as a fighter to gain lands and to bring glory to his home country.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe novel 'To Kill a Mockingbird' describes Atticus, a lawyer and father of two children as being a good leader.  He possesses characteristics comparable to no one; he maintains calamity, he is logical, he is pensive, he is impartial and he is humble.  His position in the society as a lawyer and as a parent honor these traits as very apposite.  If Atticus had lived in the period of GenGiskan where he would be expected to demonstrate a warrior personality, he probably would be doomed as a weak person, far from being similar to a good leader.\\r\\n\\r\\nNowadays, wars do not break out regularly nor do disputes for territory.  A president of a nation today would have to show qualities that prospers the nation, secure financial conditions, etc.  A president may have characters that make him a good leader, but in personal affairs he might be very poor examples.  Bill Clinton, a former president of the United States has stabilized the country economy and has performed many other good policies.  On the contrary, he was condemned to have had profligating relationships with another woman and was further reproved for his fabrications at the court.\\r\\n\\r\\nGenGiskan as a warrior, Atticus as a lawyer and a parent, and Bill Clinton as a president all are examples of a good leader.  The characters a good leader should have are modified along history. Furthermore, good leaders has to have good characters that accomodate to become a good leader.  The claim that most good leaders have not been people of good characters thus proves amiss.\",\n",

It is a very controversial issue that is hotly debated because of its complexity and the appreciable influence of movies, books, and mass media. Since antiquity, there has been some kind of censoring, sometimes to suppress subversive ideas, other times to maintain moral order. Though censorship cannot go faultless and its severity may vary, there has got to be some kind of regulations for the sake of order, sanity and morality, as history showed us. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhat would it be like with no censorship at all? Obscene articles would spring up everywhere like seeds meeting rain during a drought. People would turn out immoral things under the name of freedom of art, literature, and expression. Even with censorship, there are plenty of accessible pornography through share-file programs. Without restrictions, more crimes related to the obscene, violent media would appear; such as the 10year old boy who raped his classmate lately.\\r\\n\\r\\nReligions would be another good subject to make fun of.

I also consider it not safe to let mankind it duplicate itself. \\r\\n\\r\\nFirst, it is because it could cause people to think life carelessly. For an example, lets say you got hurt in an car accident. The doctor says that your leg will have to be amputated. In present, this is a serious problem.

I don\\'t have to look out for injuries!\"\\r\\nWell, if they do, I\\'d like to tell them that it wouldn\\'t do any good if they die before they can have any part of their body cloned.\\r\\n\\r\\nSecond, the world might fall in danger.

It is understandable that some human rights organizations look upon the assisted suicide as another form of murder. Therefore, they claim, doctors who took part in this unhuman operation must be prosecuted. However, when one analyzes this issue impartially, it becomes clear that doctors should not be prosecuted for ending a life for the good of everybody.\\r\\n     First of all, assisted suicide is a legalized process that can only take place with the accords of the patient involved and his or her family. In other words, doctors merely took the role of an executioner. Doctors were not involved in the decision-making process. Doctors simply followed the will of the patient. Never in history has an executioner been blamed for the loss of lives on a gallow, or in modern times, in a hospital.\\r\\n     Second of all, the doctors who performed the assisted suicide did not end life, but pain. This operation is always the last resort taken only in extreme circumstances. It becomes an option only when there is hardly no hope left at all, if there is at all, and when the benefits outweigh the disadvantages. In a way, and most of the time, the patient who goes through the assisted suicide is not a living person, but a living corpse.

The Lord of the Flies by William Golding was told, people were mesmerized by its irony and truth. Peter Brook who made black and white version in 1964, kept to the integrity of the story. However, Harry Hook chooses to break the tradition and shows his lack of creativity by maintaing some characters, altering the point of view , and ignoring the themes.\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n             Harry Hook maintains the main characters same compare to the novel, however, he changes the others. Also, unlikely the novel, there is an adult who was the pilot who manages to live. Ralph is still reasonable and fair. He is betrayed by all the boys and his worthy friends are killed by others. His personality doesn't differ from the book. Piggy is intelligent, but no one cares for him. Simon is still spiritual and seeks for his truth. Moreover, the leader of savages is Jack who represents the dictatorship and provides boys with more fear. With force, Roger destructs everything and finally kills Piggy. However, Sam and Eric are not followers; they represent followers in the novel. They stay with Ralph till Piggy's death in the book. In contrast, they follow Jack and join his tribe even before Simon's death. Therefore, the story is never the same although other characters remain the same. Suddenly, in the movie, there are an adult man in the island, and after Simon's death, there are only Piggy and Ralph as remainders.\\r\\n\\r\\n  \\r\\n\\r\\n Changing a novel into a movie requires a point of view alteration; novel is third person omniscient, but the movie is objective point of view. Throughout the novel, Golding tells us how they feel, and we go into the boy’s consciousness. For example, Simon talks with the Lord of the flies in the novel, but he just watches the lord of flies in the movie. Also, Golding tells us about the character’s characteristics, but in the movie, we have to watch them and figure out by ourselves. When the novel says, “the fair hair boy,” who was Ralph, we watch a boy with blond hair in the movie. As a result, the audiences miss the most important part from the novel, which is Simon’s conversation with Lord of the Flies, and some of audiences miss the theme.\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n One of the theme of this story is everlasting man’s dilemma; the evil in man. This major important theme is ignored in this movie. All of sudden, Hook brings adults to the island. However, Golding plans to have beasts that did not exist outside, but in the boy’s. In contrast, Hook makes the fact that beasts were actual human. The important part of the book is missing in this movie. Also, Ralph and Piggy receive an accordion from the sea and play it together. They only receive a dead hope, the pilot in the novel. However, they become more hopeful, and it seems like there is hope, when there was none. Themes have become unclear in the movie.\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n Even though the novel, The Lord of the Flies is remade, the quality has been decreased, because hook changed the great novel’s depth by alerting its characters, the point of views and the themes. He maintained the main characters, but changed the surrounding ones like Sam and Eric. Then, there was an adult in the island, who was the evil. There are many little incidents that were not in the book, including receiving the accordion from the sea, makes the themes unclear. In addition, they were lack of capacity of keeping the point of view and miss the key part from the book that supports the theme that has been weakened. Thankfully, there are truths that do not change in years in the original book by Golding that have been remade in films and loved by many audiences that keep to the tradition and the remarkable story.\",\n",

In today’s society, citizens are unconsciously censored in many ways from multimedia production to newspapers.  Government or someone’s biased opinions struck people’s thoughts and this will cause people to believe what they’ve said.  The result of censorship is highly dangerous. Suppression through censorship should be ended although it is inconceivable that it will ever be eliminated.\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\n Reasons for censorship are varied.  Censorship provokes people of control of thought and action from the TV.  For some “TV babies,” they will mostly remember how actors or characters behaved when they got into such incidents.  Their reflections, overtaken by TV, will cause them to have lack of knowledge as a result.  \\r\\nThis affects them to have hard time interacting with others by continually long hours of numbness.    Moreover, to some TV producers, the shortage of citizen’s thinking is always plus for their authority. \\r\\nMoney makings are all they think about, not young children’s lives.  As this process progresses, multimedia restriction of people’s thoughts will eventually brainwash all the people.This work will rouse them to feel that they are the spectators and TV will do all the work.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nHaving many risks in people’s lives, censorship has appalling notion among people.  Censorship interrupts people from nurturing more knowledge, which will spread boundaries to their thinking.  As an example, to TV generations, absence and silence of entertainment is critical.  This makes tough for them to having participation on their education and puts down significance of their study.\\r\\nTheir future will be enclosed and further imagining won’t be allowed by TV.  Children’s reflections will be abandoned.  Eventually people’s lives will be always beyond the truths ? the truths about their beliefs, and the TV.  Their decision to help someone in necessary situation could be banned through TV, because to them, watching TV could be more realistic.\\r\\nOverall, the value of censorship is all about control.  TV will wish for citizens to do exactly what they want them to do and citizens will follow it out of their “wrong” conception.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEffect of censorship is horrifying and dreadful.  As mentioned above, once boundaries are set to people’s thinking, they get to lose their analytical thinking.  This can provoke young viewers to take drugs because TV actually taught of using drugs.  It means their organization for thinking will apparently fall down.\\r\\nThis then will block citizen’s ways of imagining and it leads them as another victim of the society.  More than anything else, people’s understanding will be passed down to generations, which causes blindness of their history and wrongness of their beliefs.  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter all, it is about power which people are having concentration upon.  To be the top and to gain more control over others, inspiration of censorship will be dragged down to the end.  It is immoral how people should live under government’s command and how government’s restrictions having influence over citizens.

What I need to start doing is running everyday, cut down on junk foods, do helpful things when relaxing, such as thinking rather than watching TV, and sleeping regularly, preferably not at school.  \\r\\n\\r\\nWhile reading is crucial in developing your mind, I improve my computer game’s skills by doing them two hours everyday, and play piano and violin three times a week for half an hour each. I also have a habit to look for everything that is related to a matter or topic I am interested in. Everyday, I read one or two chapters and finish a book in a week. Occasionally, if the book really interests me, I finish it in one day, whether it is short or extremely long. Despite the fact that I read a lot, playing computer games is more imperative in developing my mind. When I am concentrating in one thing, I take too much time doing only it that I lose precious time to do much more. I need to stop playing computer games and restart my job as an editorial writer in ‘So Nyun Dong-A’ daily newspaper. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe relationship building is the finest way of caring your heart. I phone with my dad twice for 30minutes everyday. My friends and I chat almost everyday from seven to eight thirty because of the time difference. If one of my friends is telling me something that she doesn’t want anybody else to know, I keep it to myself. Every time I talk with my friends, I say one nice thing. Lastly, I laugh much. My friends say that I was born to laugh. Smile is not my specialty, but I laugh more than 200 times a day. I find it hard to like someone who doesn’t like me. I am not an angel kind of person, but I usually don’t have any feelings for them. I have to start trying to like those who might even detest me.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, caring for my soul is done in several different ways. I go to the movies at least twice a month and rent videos every week because they always teach me something. I watch television and forget to meditate or think deeply. I will start writing a journal, and I will stop being entertained by unnecessary things.\\r\\nAfter listing in details what I do everyday, I’ve noticed certain patterns in my bad habits; excessive net surfing, and distracting amusement. Since I started writing the paper, I realized how much time I spend pointlessly. I am now aware of the specific circumstances I fall into. For the body and heart, the habits I practice have a positive influence on my life. However, caring for mind and soul is not my specialty, and I understand that most of the common bad habits stop me from caring my mind and soul. While stopping a bad habit is harder than starting one, and causes a bit of confusion along with disorder, I will be able to stop a bad habit with keeping my good habits.',\n",

When he reached the world, he asked a man which God of all the mighty Gods was the greatest. The man replied that Apollo, the God of the Sun who provides sunlight to human beings is the most extraordinary and magnificent God. Poseidon then asked the man, isn’t Poseidon the greatest of almighty for he smashes stones and rocks to pieces, causes enormous tempest, and shakes the seashore with his powerful trident, expecting a satisfying and honorable answer from the mortal. Amazingly, the man made a wry face saying how can Poseidon be compared to Apollo for he only enjoys himself of his golden horses pulling his two-wheeled cart above the surface of the oceans. Infuriated and provoked by the man’s discourteous reaction, Poseidon vigorously agitated for his indignation to jealousy. With the resentments still blazed up, he went forth to Olympus swearing to treat Apollo cruelly for his majestic works. There, in the boundless beauty and grandeur of Olympus, Poseidon, waving his trident above his flaming head, went to see Apollo.\\r\\n\\r\\nApollo, the comely God, son of the puissant Zeus, was playing his lyre of a sound which submerged furies and useless worries of Poseidon as he, filled with rage, was going to castigate the Lord of the sun, archery, prophecy, and all noble arts existing in this world. The naivety and equanimity of this lofty God seemed to calm Poseidon for a short moment. Told by Poseidon that Zeus was calling him, Apollo thanked him and went to meet his father. By the time Apollo came back enraged by the fact Poseidon lied to him, he was already gone with Apollo’s flaming horses. Now fleeing with horses of exquisite beauty, Poseidon was delightful of what he had done. He who provided human horses was stressed out because those of Apollo’s were superior. Upset and troubled, he turned Apollo’s flaming horses into sea horses. Realizing that his horses were turned into walruses, Apollo, with the help of Zeus, made men become aware of the knowledge of fishing and the ability to deal with sea creatures. From then on, human beings developed skills to capture living things in seas and ways to satisfy their hunger with them.',\n",

       " ('Who is God? Is He the ruler of the universe? Is He the father of all creation? Is He a supernatural spirit? These are some of the questions we ask ourselves from now and then, only to abandon them after an unfruitful search for truth, for the sake of our mental stability. Although many people believe in God’s existence, they have come up with myriad of different explanations of God’s identity. Each of the three mainstreams among them uses the psychological approach, the biological approach, and the philosophical approach in order to answer the question of who God is.\\r\\n\\tA psychologist may be a believer or a nonbeliever. Regardless, a psychological approach to explain the nature of God is bound to have its roots in human minds, and therefore generally ends up undermining the religious faith. Taking a step aside from the main question of Who Is God? a more interesting one posed by psychologists is Why do/don’t we believe in God. There are numerous convincing answers proposed: peer pressure, following of role models, personal interests, and personal convenience. One born in a Christian community is expected to be a Christian; one’s role model may be the God-defying Achilles; one may have found comfort in a religious system; one may not wish to abide by the restrictions imposed on a believer. All the four examples given are likely to be true for many, and there rise the inner conflicts. \\r\\nWhen it comes to reasons as to why believe in God, the psychological factors dominate over the rational reasoning for the masses of the people, and psychologists are no exceptions. Mortimer Adler, an American psychologist who spent the bulk of his career thinking about God and religious topics wrote in his autobiography, Philosopher at Large (1976), “To become seriously religious would require a radical change in my way of life…The simple truth of the matter is that I did not wish to live up to being a genuinely religious person.” \\r\\nPresumably the reader has by now noticed with bitterness that, “…the psychological concepts used quite effectively to interpret religion are two-edged sword that can also be used to interpret atheism. Sauce for the believer is equally sauce for the unbeliever. (Professor Paul C. Vitz, The Psychology of Atheism, p. 1)” Professor Vitz, in his attack of psychoanalysis for providing only poor theoretical concepts, interprets the Oedipus Complex of Freud (a boy in his childhood allays his fear and hatred toward the father by identifying himself with the father) in a new light; he argues that according to this set-up, atheism is comparable to the boy overcoming his fear and hatred by killing and replacing the father. “In essence,” says he, “man-through his narcissism and Oedipal wishes-has tried to succeed where Satan failed, by seating himself on the throne of God.”',\n",

       " ('The main branch for the biological approach in answering the question of who God is is the sociobiology. The sociobiology is based on a central theme, that people need God. Humans have held beliefs toward God in one form or the other all through their history, although they had little proofs of his existence or his work on earth. The so-called miracles attributed to the hand of God could always have been explained through common sense or rational thinking. The psychologists are aware of the confirmation bias ?tendency of human beings to remember events that confirm their beliefs but forget those that do not. However, even today, when science has given us more understanding of the world we live in than religion has, when medicine has cured more people than religion has, when technology has improved the quality of life more than religion has, and when there seems to be little room for religion with the advent of modern science, not only the beliefs in God are hanging in there, but they exhibit no sign of fading away into the history records. \\r\\n     The sociobiologists think that they have an answer to this phenomenon; we have it because we need it. According to the sociobiology, human behaviors are heavily affected by the interactions of genes; all the outside influences such as experience, environment, etc. affect human behaviors to a certain degree within the contour laid out by genes. \\r\\n     Edward O. Wilson of Harvard University who popularized sociobiology, proposed the gene-culture coevolution theory ?cultural influences favor the selection and evolution of particular genetic tendencies. In the prescience era, religion satisfactorily met many demands humans needed. It explained natural phenomena, created a sense of well being, provided emotional satisfaction and social life, brought people together, and relieved the leaders of society from blame when things went wrong. Thus, says sociobiology, the human mind evolved to believe in God.',\n",

       " ('The philosophical approach has been practiced by great thinkers in order to answer the question of who God is. At the time of the early Greek philosophers, the popular belief had been that of gods. Philosophers at first tried to separate their philosophy and religion, or to render support to their religion with the aid of philosophy. The pioneer to speak out against the belief of the masses was Heraclitus. He criticized those who bowed to pictures and statues without any thoughts. Next came Xenophanes who believed in monotheism in contrast to the popular polytheism. He taught that God was one and all, the universe, and different from human beings in every way. In short, God is God, and we are not. \\r\\nPlato’s God was the ruler of the universe, and the goal toward which everything strived. He believed that our mind was like God, and our body a prison keeping the mind. Plato wrote, “…we ought to fly away from earth as quickly as we can, and to fly away is to become like God” (Basic Teachings of the Great Philosophers, p. 105). Aristotle’s description of God was similar to that delineated by Plato. Aristotle’s God was pure form, form without matter, the cause of all motions yet unmoved Himself.\\r\\n     Two men represent the early and medieval Christian conception of God, Saint Augustine and Thomas Aquinas. Augustine taught that God was omnipotent. For him God was the absolute, the cause of everything, the embodiment of all the virtues, and the one who preordained the fate of all His creations. Aquinas uses Aristotle’s teaching of an Unmoved Mover as a basis of his belief. The God of Aquinas was the perfect that stood on top of the ladder of the universe, the first and final cause of everything. Aquinas’s beliefs served as a blueprint for the Catholic Church, and they are still so to this day.\\r\\n     Following the Renaissance and the Age of Reason, theology and science were no longer one. Faithful to the trend, Francis Bacon divided the theology into two components, the natural and the revealed. The former could be found, but the latter had to be revealed. Bacon asserted that all we could know for sure was God’s existence. Also during this period in history, the advent of science challenged the Christian theology. In an attempt to reconcile the two, Spinoza insisted that God is all, and all is God. Body and mind are God seen in two different ways, and all the thoughts in the world added up make up the God’s thought. \\r\\n      There were philosophers who thought that God’s existence could not be proven, Immanuel Kant and William James. Both of them agreed that whether God really existed or not, and whatever the true nature of God was if he did, the idea of God was necessary for the morality and satisfaction of man. Kant further believed that God was the highest form of thinking or notion possible.\\r\\nThe three approaches investigated, psychological, biological, and philosophical, were all intended to explain the nature of God. Who is God? Our fathers asked this question. So did their grandfathers, and so did the Greeks. It is the same question humans brooded for over two thousand years. Some answers were satisfying for a period of time, but none were satisfactory for a long time. Modern science has changed views held for centuries, and what the future will bring we can only imagine. THE answer is like an asymptote of a graph; however close we may go near it, it will be beyond grasp. Nonetheless man will never give up the question he has raised once upon a time, he will continue asking.',\n",

Of course, it is nice to be handsome, and it is understandable why people wish to look that way, sometimes there are changes in how people treat you, but being obsessed by it is strange. \\r\\n     Physical appearance is something that is volatile. The definition of beauty is different from culture to culture. Western people wondered whether the Eastern people could breathe all right, and the Eastern people wondered whether the Western people used their pointy nose for drilling.

Some harsh people go so far as saying that those who always want to look pretty do so because they are uneasy about th eir inner shallowness, and they either want to cancel it out by decorating themselves, or they have no other way to be conspicuous. This is what is happening nowadays. The media tells people what is beautiful, and the people struggle to match the ideal as best as possible.

       " ('Often, false ambitions lead to self-destruction causing others around to suffer as well. These ambitions are not always intentional or intended to harm others, but are the results of a human뭩 natural instinct based on his character. In the 밢dyssey,?for example, Odysseus?aspirations for new adventures result in the death of his mates. Similar to this, general Zaroff in 밫he Most Dangerous Game,?takes away innocent lives to satisfy his craving for danger. Causing harm to a person does not only involve death. It can be caused in many different forms that sometimes, may be more painful than death itself. This is clearly shown in 밃 Raisin in the Sun,?through Walter뭩 careless mistake that makes Beneatha뭩 dream hard to realize. \\r\\nWhen Odysseus?men plead Odysseus to return to their ship before danger attacks them, he refuses because his instinct is telling him not to. This is an egoistic decision considering that he also feels the menace. He says that he knew 몊ome towering brute would be upon them soon ?all outward power, a wild man, ignorant of civility.?Odysseus is certain that his wits are superior compared to those of any other man. Believing in oneself is usually harmless and rather positive. However, too much concentration on oneself is no more self-confidence or pride, but arrogance. Ambition along with arrogance is very, very likely to fail, because one does not weigh the risks that outweigh the benefits, having no doubt that nothing can harm him. When in danger, fear will be suddenly felt, but he will not or would not want to admit that he fears the situation, and this causes the person to act in an impudent way. This is the case of Odysseus when the giant Cyclops threatens him. He does not even realize that he is or has to be afraid because his will is so powerful and tenacious. He gets out of the cave safely, but his six men are killed. Encouraged by the fact that his wits freed him and his remaining mates, he again puts them in danger by scorning the Cyclops. Furious, the Cyclops throws several rocks, trying to damage the ship. If not luck was with them, they all would have died.\\r\\nStrong but death causing ambition is discussed in 밫he Most Dangerous Game.?As Odysseus is proud of his wits, Zaroff takes pride in his ability to hunt. The hunter뭩 pride is more than self-confidence. It is the basis of a cruel and intentional murder, which he considers a game. Having hunted all kinds of animals, fear is not a consideration within the mind of the general. Desiring for more is a natural instinct of a human being. One뭩 instinct wants and demands to test his limits. Once a person thinks of oneself as unconquerable, self-destruction and mischief of others around occur. In order to content his desire for startling excitements, general Zaroff dares to destroy ships passing by and forces people to be his 밾untees.?His burning passion makes him to ruin more and more people and his overconfidence is finally defeated by Rainsford. \\r\\nSome might wonder what can be worse than death, and losing hope is. Walter, in 밃 Raisin in the Sun,?takes the family뭩 hope away by losing all the money, including Beneatha뭩 schooling. Beneatha thinks her life is over because her hope is now no more than echoes of dreams. Ruth is desperate because she loses her hope of moving to the new house. Mama뭩 hope of starting a new life is ruined. All these are caused by Walter뭩 false ambition. Of course, it is an instinct to want to achieve success, to feel important and respected, but it is wrong to act only with instincts. This careless mistake also takes away his hope because he will have few chances to possess such great amount of money.\\r\\nMany problems usually occur because one acts only with instincts. Most of the time, ambitions are based on instincts, making them harder to realize. These are often false aspirations, which demand other뭩 sacrifice to achieve the goal. The above three examples show the consequences that follow after hasty decisions and means to satisfy one뭩 wants. To prevent these destructions from happening, everyone needs to help each other and sacrifice their time and efforts. When these are well combined and cooperated, no one would lose hope or suffer.',\n",

Nothing bothered me until ‘their God’ seemed to be irritated and began to curse me.\\r\\nIt all happened on a Friday afternoon, on February 1987. That morning, I woke up at four thirty sweating all over and screaming. My heart was beating without stopping and the nightmare gave me a chill; a person with no eyes was smiling mockingly and running after me. I tried to run away but my legs were cut off, so I tried to call for help but my voice was lost in the wind. I had one of those nightmares two days ago, too and it terrified me. A little frustrated, I calmed down myself thinking it was the result of too much work and that exercise would help me get rid of those nightmares. My eyes were still half-closed and I kept yawning. Tired and exhausted, I lied down on my bed but sleep wouldn’t welcome me. At five o’clock the phone rang.\\r\\n“Hello! This is Jeff speaking,” I answered, yawning.\\r\\n“Hi Jeff. I’m Tom. Sorry to wake you up so early, but I was urgent, you see.”\\r\\nSurprised, I quickly got up from my bed and stood straight as if Tom, my boss was right in front of me. “Good morning sir,” I replied with a firm voice, “Yes sir, uh… But I’m not good at negotiating, sir.

Have a good morning sir.” With the clacking sound, I put the phone down and sighed.\\r\\nThe morning meeting with the Chinese minister was about to begin. At eight, I was to meet with that chubby Chinese guy to discuss the construction of Disney world in Beijing. He came in at last, with an arrogant look on his face. You can do it, I said to myself. Don’t be nervous. Just be who you are. We first shared greetings of course, and started our conversation with a short, sympathetic talk. During the negotiation, that guy drove me crazy; he was sipping water and kept sweating. However, the real problem was money. It always is a problem. \\r\\n“Mr. Chang. Let’s have a break for a minute. I suppose you are also tired, aren’t you?” I finally said.\\r\\n“Sure I will Jeff. It’s hot in here,” he answered again sipping his water.\\r\\nI didn’t really appreciate the fact that he was calling me by my first name, but I didn’t care. I was going back to where I was sitting when suddenly, a loud boom struck my ears. It was soon followed by hysterical shouts, “The plane!” It was then I saw a plane crashing into the next building. The emergency bell rang frantically, and I could hear cries everywhere.  For a moment, I couldn’t believe my eyes. The struggling of people attempting escape from this fatal situation only seemed to me as a mirage. And out of the blue, started somewhere, a fire was burning away the whole building I was in. It was slowly coming up, advancing menacingly to where I was. It was threatening to end up my life but I didn’t feel like anything. All just didn’t seem real. I closed my eyes tightly, but it was impossible to shut out the vision of what was happening all around me. I still don’t know why I closed my eyes, though. Nearby buildings erupted into showers of cements, bricks, and dust. Even though I knew I should fight for my life, I couldn’t move. A similar sensation of nightmare engulfed me. It surely was not a pleasant one, and that’s for sure. The only thing that was not the same was that I didn’t shout for help. That didn’t really matter. \\r\\nSlowly, warily, I opened my eyes. I found myself being one of the not brainy people, pushing others to get through the emergency stairs. But I soon stopped doing that because I felt I should not be a part of the not brainy. I tried to find a way out to any door, and I did found one. It led to the eighty-fourth floor. Feeling safe for a moment, I looked out the window beside me. I shouldn’t have; it wasn’t exciting to see people crashed by the debris, to see the dead bodies, to see the huge building on fire, to see smoke filling the sky. Terrified, I was running in every direction trying to think of a way to escape death. However, I soon realized that the whole floor was on fire, and if I did not think of something quickly, I would turn into a handful of ash. I couldn’t decide whether to die with my body on fire or jumping out the window was more appropriate. Now that I think back, I shouldn’t have looked for an appropriate way to die, but to live. Sketching myself turning into ashes was not enjoyable. I preferred to be remembered and honored of being brave even in such horrifying conditions. I do not exactly recall what I did next, but I guess I jumped out the window for I heard the glass breaking and felt like flying. \\r\\nDuring my courageous action, I remembered her. An enthusiast of dandelion, she looked at them differently, even when she looked at them under a dim light of dawn, in the freezing winter air, or for her whole life. I remembered her flawless tanned skin, gorgeous enough to make me fear, and her warm, contagious laugh. I remembered her voice, soft and sweet like a skylark whistling in my ears, sometimes firm and strong but never without its softness. I remembered her silhouette that was one time, the most beautiful thing I’ve ever seen. And now, I wouldn’t see her any more. And for the first time of my life, I began to care.\\r\\n Disappointed that nothing would keep me alive, I began to cry. Actually, tears didn’t come out but I really felt like crying. It was certain that I was falling, and I wondered why I wasn’t unconscious like any others in Hollywood movies. Movie stars were not to blame. I was. I remembered about my favorite ice cream, cookie and cream with caramel syrup. I remembered the day my mom died and I felt sick in my stomach. She had cursed me before dying, which probably was the result of being ignorant and disobedient to her. Maybe I was falling right now, because of her curse. I also remembered my dog, Kitty, and I tried to found out why I named it Kitty. I didn’t know. Certain that death was calling me, I again remembered her. It was sad to die like this without even knowing her name. Coming back to reality, I looked down. I shouldn’t have. I could see crowds and cars getting bigger - it was over.\\r\\nNow, here I am lying on my bed preparing for a journey to the other world. Eyes blind and legs cut off. Blaming God is the only thing I can do on my own. My nurse is a chubby Chinese. This one also sweats much, but now, I don’t really care. Today, reporters will come to interview me. They want to do a report on my miraculous survival. It bothers me because I didn’t want to be alive. The brainy me is now gone. I’m now only one of those disabled who can’t even get up on its own. Oh, and due to publicity, I now know her name. Cora Malesky. It looks like an old lady’s, but it doesn’t matter. All that is left for me now is to blame God and remember her.

And I became Genghis Khan.”  \\r\\nEnlarging the boundaries in the three fields mentioned above with zeal, and hopefully with ‘inner peace’, is my goal and what I define ‘success.’ Everyone has limits to overcome, and by applying my definition, nobody needs to go down to serve as manure for someone else’s triumph. After all everybody has a right to succeed.',\n",

The examples of Napleon’s incessant wars, America’s negligence and the luxurious woman in Maupassant’s The Necklace show this to be true.\\r\\nOne example of such sorrow shows up in Napleon’s act and its effect on himself.  His tenacity in expanding France’s territory through wars seemed at first beneficial and effective.  However, the glorious accomplishments ended miserably, putting Napleon in exile and out of his people’s favors.  All this misery was because of his love for battles that once made him a hero. \\r\\nAnother example of self-destruction is pictured in the carelessness of the United States. A terror attack had been forewarned to the intelligence forces but their failure to pay attention on those notices resulted in the harming of many innocent citizens.  America wouldn’t have undergone the dreadful incident on 9.11. if they hadn’t been so inattentive.\\r\\nA third example appears in The Necklace. The poor woman has an absurd dream, to be the most luxurious and dazzling one in the coming party.  Her practice for her desires distinguishes her for a short moment but ruins her life forever; the precious time she spends on meeting her debts is at last proved worthless.\\r\\nIn the paragraphs above, I have shown that the basis for the worst sorrows is ourselves.  No other troubles us more than we can.',\n",

       " ('What is sin? Many people have different answers, each of which sounds plausible. For example, my sister professes that, “Sin is a rebellious act against God,” while my mom argues that, “It is doing something against God’s will.” And the Bible says that, “Sin is breaking God’s law and command.” Thus, we have a pretty clear image of sin, and can recognize it fairly easily. Let us look farther into it. \\r\\n       When Adam and Eve disobeyed God’s order, they made the first sin, and brought it in the world. Since then, we became mortal and could not avoid suffering/sinning, and it has been affecting us in many ways: it alienated a person from oneself, God, nature, and another person. It also alienated one nation from another nation as well. With sin around us, we would never acquire an eternal peace in mind. However, Jesus Christ cared enough about us to create man and woman in his own image (Genesis 1:27), and died on the cross in order to save us from sin, both physically and mentally. \\r\\n       There are two kinds of sin. One is commission, and the other is omission. At the personal level, the first one is doing something what we are not supposed to do. The latter is not doing something we are supposed to do. At the social level, the first one is following the crowd doing wrong, and the latter is not opposing the crowd. So not only we need to not do what he had forbidden us, but we also need to do what he told us to do. Therefore, not helping the poor is a sin as well as stealing something.\\r\\n        We have actually seen or heard the effect of sin many times, and read about its consequence throughout the history. For example, there were too much sin at Sodom and Gomorra. Therefore, their fate was obvious. We should try our best to not sin, and ask for forgiveness to God when we committed one. That way, we will get closer to God who will grant peace within our hearts. \\r\\n       There is one more reason what we should not sin. There is this thing called ‘guilt’ that is the byproduct of sin. Guilt destroys our mental health, and makes us miserable unless we acknowledge our faults and repent. In other words, suffering and death are not punishments from God, but a product of sin itself.        \\r\\n       God gave us a thing called ‘conscience’ which can naturally distinguish between sin and good deeds. Based on this, social rules are created to keep a social order. It is when we know these rules and order, but deliberately slight and violate them for our own egoistic convenience and avarice that sin forms and we experience the dishonest feelings strongly. After sinning, we may taste and feel the sweetness of temptation, but that rapture is not a true rapture, nor does it last for long. \\r\\n       After all, we are living by the grace of God, whose love and mercy never stops though we continuously sinned and betrayed him. Here is one of my favorite verse: “For God so loved the world that he gave his only Son, so that everyone who believes in him might not perish but might have eternal life. (John 3:16)” Most important of all, we must not try to be like God, and we should pray and read the Bible constantly to renew ourselves.',\n",

That\\'s the reason why he lose the power, and also the reason why controlling people with fear is not sustainable.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Easily seen teachers who always scold and punish students harshly can not control students well because of that threatening method. They usually thinks that so young and energetic students can be controlled by punishment. But those teachers\\' punishments become ineffective as time goes.

Cloning humans has become a huge moral issue and many people are confused by it. However, one thing is certain that there is no reason or no right to clone humans.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the fundamental problems of cloning is the personal identity. If the 'new being is produced by cloning, and he is told that he is not really a human-being then what would he feel about himself. Imagine that one day people come to you and say that you are a clone of somebody. How would you feel? Many clones would want to run away from the truth. Humans have always tried to know about themselves thus they continuously study themselves. Therefore, they would panic when they become confused about their own identities. Would clones be different? Same thing would happen to clones. They would become confused and maybe their rationalities would break down.\\r\\n\\t\\r\\nScientists who argued for cloning asserted that clones can be used to heal ill people. Those scientists said that they can replenish sick people's organs with clones'. Since these beings are alive and would have thoughts like other ordinary human-beings, they should be treated as we might treat other humans. Then using these people's organs would not be right since no human beings should donate their own organs unless they want. Therefore, those scientists' reason for cloning is not valid.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is said that possibility of cloning any living things successfully is very low. Before \\r\\nmaking 'Dolly', scientists had to get rid of many unsuccessful attempts. There might be some creatures that almost became 'sheep'.

However, since it was clone of human, can we kill it without becoming a murderer? This is another big problem.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe problem of personal identity is very important one considering that the clone is also a human-being. Furthermore, making clones for replenishing other people's organs cannot be a valid reason. Finally, the possibility of making a 'monster' with the human-rights can be a real problem.

Although some people believe so, reasons for the existence for the laws are not limited to catching and punishing criminals. There are other important reasons as well.\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst of all, laws can scare any potential criminals from causing harm against \\r\\nlaw-abiding people. All people know that when they violate laws, they will be punished. They can be fined, jailed, or even executed. Punishing people is a very effective way to prevent crimes. For instance, when children do something bad, their parents scold them and tell them not to do the same thing again. If the children do the same things again, then they would be severly punished. Therefore, next time, they would try not to commit such things. It is same with people. People see other people who committed crimes and get punished. Thus, people refrain themselves from violating laws. This is one of the prime reasons for the existence of law other than punishing criminals.\\r\\n\\r\\nNext, laws exist to teach people what they have to do at least to make them 'human'. My middle school Ethics teacher once told us that the there are circles which restrict human behaviors. He said that those circles surround us and each one gets bigger and bigger. The first one was ethics. The next one was etiquettes. The third one was rules and the biggest circle was law. Thus, he said, if we go beyond the 'law circle' then we can no longer be called 'human' because laws are things what humans should at least abide. Therefore, people can know what they have to do to become human because of laws.\\r\\n\\r\\nFurthermore, laws make people feel safe. Although, some people might argue that making people feel safe is the natural consequence of the law's function as catching and punishing criminals, it is different. Law-enforcers always do not catch criminals thus the function does not always works. However, the existence of law and hope of people that criminals would one day get punished make people feel safe. People know that other people would not try to foolish things because violators of laws become punished sooner or later.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough some people argue that the sole reason laws exist is to catch and punish but it is not true. Laws exist to prevent potential criminals and teach people what they have to do to become 'human'. Moreover, laws exist to make people feel safe.\",\n",

For example, one professor got his note-book-computer robbed. The biggest problem was that his research paper was saved in it. When he received his computer back, his research paper was no longer there. Professor became disheartened so much that he could not start next patent. The same thing will happen to people who get their patents robbed. Therefore, intellectual properties such as patents and research papers, that might become an infrastructure of new branch of science should be regulated.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot protecting intellectual properties would also damage people's reputation. Assume that scientist A made a new medicine that can cure AIDS. However, scientist B stole A's technology published it faster. Then all the honor will go to scientist B even though he did nothing. Therefore, scientist A's chance of becoming famous had gone and he will feel deep sorrow about it.\\r\\n\\r\\nIntellectual properties should be protected at any cost because protecting it will give incentives to scientists and researchers to produce more patents and papers. Furthermore, it will give them more incentives by giving good reputation which they deserve.\",\n",

However, as the technology advanced more and more, the food chain changed and humans started hunting tigers and wolves. Although, humans kill animals for food, they are treating them worse and worse that they think that they can do anything they want.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany people enjoy hunting. While some of them eats what they catch, others just enjoy killing. They just kill and kill and leave the trails of corpse behind. Although, there are laws which restrict hunters' behaviors, those hunters do not always get caught. Do animals deserve death? What right do we have so that we can kill animals for fun? This things does not make sense. It is clear that humans do not have rights to use animals as they wish.\\r\\n\\r\\nSometimes, humans abuse animals too cruelly. For example, shark-hunters who hunt for shark's fins so they can sell them, catch sharks and then cut the fins. Then they just throw shark in to the water again. Shark, which cannot swim without fins goes deep down to the sea and get killed by small fishes which cleans sea floors. This can be compared to cutting our hands and feet and leaving us in the forest. Does humans have this rights? No, it has gone too far. In order to keep us alive, we have to it. However, God did not tell us to kill animals even if we do not need them for food.\\r\\n\\r\\nFurthermore, it is hard to imagine what people do to laboratory animals. On television, we can easily watch scientists who inject unknown substance into the mouse. Then the mouse starts shaking and later it dies. Can humans do this? What right do we have? Although we say that we should protect the poor and the weak, we do not protect mouse.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is rather difficult to talk about the rights of animals because we have considered \\r\\nthem as food and toy for a long time.

I know in my heart that it will help me go through difficulties and later in my life, I will always feel grateful toward my coach for teaching those valuable lessons.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom learning running, I acquired many knowledge. The first thing I learned from my coach was how much I had to run to complete the race. I learned that when I want to run 800m race, I had to know that the distance was 800m. I should run as I would run 800m, not 400m or 1 mile. This was very important lesson. Whenever people face difficulties, some people often exaggerate the situation to themselves and they cannot run because they fear too much. It is the same as thinking 800m race as 40km race. On the other hand some people tend to think 800m obstacle as 400m obstacle. This people try to pass the obstacles, however, these people become exhausted before passing them. Therefore learning that I should know how much I had to run to finish the race was very influential lesson.\\r\\n\\r\\nNext, I learned the virtue of 'endurance' from learning how to run. When I first started running, I easily became tired and wanted to stop running. Sometimes, while running, my heart hurt so much that I thought that I was going to die. Whenever I saw vast track ahead of me, I wanted to stop and walk away from it. However, I did not stop running. As time passed by, I got more used to it and I could endure more and more. My attitude toward life also changed too. Before learning how to run, I easily gave up whenever I saw a huge obstacle in front of me. I could not endure all the difficulties I had to go through to pass the obstacle. After learning how to run, I could start enduring the pain that I received from passing the obstacle.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom learning how to run, the confidence inside me started growing. When my coach told me to run 3km, I thought to myself that it was impossible and I will die before completing the race. Before I told my coach about it, he forced me to run and I barely finished 3km race. After completing the race, I found myself alive and the confidence inside me began to grow. As I completed more and more race, I became more confident and whenever I faced the obstacle, I knew that I could surpass it.\\r\\n\\r\\nUntil now, I faced many difficulties and I know that I will face them more in the future. However, I know that my 'running' experience will help me surmount all the obstacles. With the knowledge about the 'mountain' in front of me, confidence in myself that I can climb it, and endurance will let me pass the obstacle.\",\n",

Some of these miserable people have strong beliefs that they are going to be cured, but most of them just give up their lives. These terminally ill people should have the right to control their own death, as the last consideration for them.\\r\\n\\r\\n There are countless diseases that can make people terminally ill, such as cancer, AIDS, leukemia, and a lot more. From these diseases people suffer for life, and even to death. They feel pain in two ways, physically from the pain that they get from their body, and mentally from the fact that they have to leave their family behind them irreponsibly. When people get infected with these kind of diseases, they usually wish to die except some strong minded people who believes that they could live, which some people succeed in. For example, few years ago in Korea there was a person who was infected with cancer, but he didn't give up his life that easily. He prayed a lot, and finally was cured and that was the motive for him to become a Christian. This indicates that his strong belief in living cured his disease.\\r\\n\\r\\nImagine how hard it would be to have a deadly disease which could finalize your life. Being terminally ill is equal to suffering for the rest of one's life. Because a sufferer has to take medicines, get surgeries, and some has to stay in the hospital for months or years, so they can't do much things as they want to do. The ill person should have the right to control his own death, because the ill person is the only one that suffers, nobody else can suffer for him. Of course, the family takes care of him and does not wish to lose him, but he should make a decision to choose what he wants.\\r\\n\\r\\nLastly, family of terminally ill people would suffer a lot. Terminally ill people wouldn't want to see their family suffering for them, because their families have to support them and pay medical treatment bills. So, ill people become kind of a burden for their family. For example, if my family was poor and I had a cancer I would give up my life for my family, because my family wouldn't have enough money to support me.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn conclusion, terminally ill people should have the right to control their own death, because they and people around them would suffer too much. In my opinion the worst suffering is not to lose someone, but it is to see someone go through the process of suffering.

Think of increasing a large amount of these laboreres, then this region would be over populated. Second, rasining a possible clone army. Government who wants more military forces would abuse human clones on increasing their military forces. This could lead to a possible clone wars.

This large union, although considered successful, has neglected the different economic situations of many European nations. Some countries weren’t ready for the formation of this union, and yet had to sacrifice themselves for many other nations that were fully prepared. In the end, these countries reluctantly suffered from minor economic crises after joining EU. It is the better will of the whole from which minority suffers. \\r\\n\\tThe paragraphs above demonstrate our society overemphasizing the value of majority.

That was the bag I wanted so much that I was collecting money for it! Enchanted by the elegant look, I could not help ogling it for a while. Soon, the young lady, without noticing my stealthy admiration, opened her bag, took her cosmetic set out, and began to correct her make up. Then she went out with her adorable bag at the next station. Saying good bye to the darling bag, I changed my attention to the middle-aged woman who was sitting by me on the other side. She was a homely woman who carried a cheap and old sac covered with small lints. \"That looks so shoddy! If I were her, I would have thrown it away already!\" Despising her parsimony, I saw her unzipping her bag and pulling something out  of it. Then, her hands with the unidentifiable object came tome. It was a candy. The woman said to me smiling. \"GIrl, your fatigued  look reminds me of my daughter of your age. I know you get stressed from school. Take this and cheer up!\"  At that moment, I felt ice in my heart melting and barrier broken. Relishing the small gift from her, I looked at her sac again. Even though it might have been cheaper than the one I admired, from the bag, I was feeling price wormth.

However, it is also important to remember that extreme fear hinders our implementations. Independence of America, \"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\", and the formation of EU clearly support this statement.\\r\\n\\tOne example that teaches us an important lesson about fear is the Independence of America. At that time, Americans were overpowered and outnumbered by the British. Some Americans preferred cautiousness and peace while others tried to overcome fear and achieve liberty. Although the cautiousness might have elongated the peace for some extent, its excessiveness would have probably confined America under permanent colonization. It is the prevention of extreme fear that led America as one of the most liberal nations today.\\r\\n\\tAnother example illustrating the bilateral effects of fear is shown in \"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\" by Mark Twain. In this book, both the young boy Huck and a runaway slave Jim escape from their homes for adventure. Although their alertness saved them from many dangers, too much fear could have ruined them and eliminated the opportunities for further adventure.\\r\\n\\tThe final incidence giving an explanation about fear can be seen in the formation of EU. This is a large union of many different countries of Europe. Since each nation had different economic status and circumstances, many suggested to delay or to prevent the formation of EU.

Two World Wars, and the environmental destruction are some of the incidents that support this idea.\\r\\n\\tOne good example illustrating the necessity of remembering the past and avoiding identical mistakes is the League of Nations. After the World War I, President Wilson of America called for the creation of a joint council of nations called the “League of Nations” hoping that it would prevent another terrible war. However, his plan failed since major European nations such as France, England and Russia either were tepid or scoffed at the idea, and America, the very country that proposed the idea, never joined the league. This mistake in response failed to prevent the Second World War, which was even more devastating. After this war, however, everyone agreed to create and join the “United Nations”, a similar association mentioned decades ago. If people had made the same mistake in neglecting the United Nations, they could have brought about another terrible war. \\r\\n\\tAnother example showing destruction from forgetting the past is the environmental pollution. Some time after the Industrial Revolution, many Europeans, especially those in England, suffered from smog, serious air pollution. Smog was extremely harmful and created a great number of asthmatic sufferers. Obviously, people then recognized the danger of environmental pollution. However, instead of learning from this mistake, and working to prevent further pollution, people kept on repeating this error and created even more dangerous situations.

So what makes a career satisfying? \\r\\n The career has to provide certain amount of income to maintain good quality of living.

Even if a person is an CPA accounter who make lots of money, if he finds it tedious and loathsome, the carrer can't be successful. \\r\\n One has to be capable, to be better, be an expert of the job. Either by talent or effort, you have to be good at your job so that you can make the most out of it. One can't be a successful soccer player  if  he isn't good at it even if he likes playing it.

After living in a city over ten years, I can’t imagine ever living in a small town again. \\r\\n\\tOne reason why I prefer cities is transportation. Small towns and big cities both have some problems in terms of transportation. In a small town, you have to own a car to ensure a comfortable living. You can’t get around without one because the public transportation in a small isn't well developed. On the other hand, although big cities generally have heavy traffic and expensive parking, there you have a choice of taking public transportation. It’s not free, but it is often cheaper than driving when you consider gas and time. Especially if you don’t have a car, you’re better off in the city.\\r\\n\\tAlso, I love the excitement of big cities. While small towns have a slow pace, in large cities you have to adapt to a variety of situations, like finding a new route to work or trying a new restaurant. I enjoy that challenge very much. Another part of the excitement of city living is the variety of cultural activities available. There is a wide assortment of theatre, music and dance performances available in big cities. These values unflortunately, are rare in small towns.\\r\\n\\tThe final thing I like about large cities is the diversity of the people.

I beieve that when people are asked to work in groups, they tend to rely on each other too much. In another word, when they are asked to work indivisually, they tend to have a bad result or don't know what to do.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy friend is a typical type of student who is always relying onto others. When she is working in a group, she tends to get good grades. She participates well and suggests good ideas. On the other hand, when she is asked to work alone, she is susceptible to get very low marks. She doesn't know what to do and gets lost when she works indivisually. It is not that she is not a bright student. In fact she is full of good ideas and suggestions. It is just that she is not used to working alone and organizing everything without any help.\\r\\n\\r\\nLike my friend, if people get used to the team work, they might not work well indivisually. They might get used to others helps and others reliance that they might not do as well as they do in a group, even if they have a better idea.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn conclusion, I firmly belive that students should learn to work alone. I am not saying that working in a team is bad. In fact,  working in a group helps indivisuals to care about the others and work as a whole. I t also teaches students to accept others views and suggestions. What I am saying is that working indivisually has slightly more benefits. So I suggest students to work both in a team and indivisually but try to work indiviaully more and rely less on the others.\",\n",

Although the quality of human life has improved greatly over the past few centuries, the Earth is being harmed more and more by human activity. As the status of our lives increases, so does our demand from the Earth.\\r\\n\\tOne reason why I think we harm the Earth is because we deplete its limited resources. For example, excessive mining devastates vast regions, leaving them barren and useless. Deforestation removes thousands of trees thus killing plants and animals as well as destroying the ecology as a whole. We are too careless in taking what we want without giving anything back. \\r\\n\\tHeavy urbanization is another reason why I consider human activity harmful. Today there are over six billion people living in our planet and thanks to the medical improvements, the population is growing every year. Overpopulation intensifies urbanization that in response creates many problems such as high rate of crime, heavy traffic and serious pollution. Increase of population as well as heavy urbanization are some of the important factors damaging the earth.\\r\\n\\tThe last and probably the most significant damage human activity causes to earth is pollution. Nearly all areas of earth are currently suffering serious pollution. For instance, companies and communities dump waste into the water, landfills are full of trash, emissions from factories pollute the air, and barrels of industrial as well as radioactive waste constantly threaten us. If we’re not careful, we can harm our planet beyond repair. \\r\\n\\tThe paragraphs above illustrate that human activity is harmful to the earth. Our desire for better places to live greatly destroys our planet. For the better future, people must respect the earth and try to preserve it.',\n",

Those with very busy jobs away from home don’t always have time to cook and would prefer eating out. Those with enough time, however, would benefit from many advantages of eating at home. Overall, I believe that it is cheaper and healthier to eat at home. \\r\\n\\tOne reason why I would prepare food at home is the prices of meals. While eating outside may save time, the money you spend can add up. For instance, when I have dinner at a restaurant with a friend, the bill is usually over twenty dollars. I can buy a lot more groceries with that money. Moreover, even lunch at a fast-food stand usually costs five or six dollars for one person. That’s enough to cook more healthy meal at home.\\r\\n\\tAlso, eating at home is better for your health. Meals at restaurants are often high in fat and calories, and they also serve big plates of food with much more food than you need to eat at one meal. On the other hand, if you cook at home, you can maintain a balanced diet. For example, you can use margarine instead of butter on your potatoes, or not put so much cheese on top of your pizza. Also, you can serve yourself just the right amount food you need or want to consume.\\r\\n\\tThe last reason why I prefer eating at home is time. Many people claim that eating out saves much time. It is true that you don’t have to shop, or cook, or clean up when eating out. However, home cooking isn’t necessarily time-consuming. There are many simple meals that don’t take much time. In fact, it is often faster than eating out, especially if you consider the time you spend driving to a restaurant, parking, waiting for a table and food, and driving back home. \\r\\n\\tThe situations above explain why I prefer eating at home and not at restaurants. Although eating outside may be convenient, I would eat at home to save money as well as to maintain my health.',\n",

These are the people who achieve the greatest heights. The results, often loss and pain, are certainly outweighed by the greatness experienced along the way. Clearly, love, whether of life, country, or another, is worth fighting for and worth the pain that so often accompanies it. \\r\\n\\tShakespeare’s \"Romeo and Juliet\" is probably the greatest example of this idea. The passion felt by Romeo and Juliet, despite the obstacles laid out before them, made it clear that their love was more important than the inevitable fate that awaited them-death. I have no doubt that these two would have verified that a love like theirs, no matter how brief and tragic, was great. It was certainly greater than suffering a long life without a passionate love. \\r\\n\\tIn history as well, we can certainly see many who believed that love of country, no matter what the consequence, was a far greater good than to have no allegiance. The great patriot Nathan Hale held his head high at his execution and proclaimed, “I only regret that I have but one life to give for my country.” Had the great leaders of American Revolution cared more about being safe, than about love of their ideals and of their country, Americans would never have won independence from English tyranny. It was men like Nathan Hale, who were willing to lose everything in the struggle for their great love-the love of country, who were responsible for the greatness of America. \\r\\n\\tIt is without a doubt that “‘Tis better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all.” History, literature and life itself bear witness to that idea every day.',\n",

In the past, I got so self-conscious that I had trouble making new friends- afraid  of intruding, afraid of being annoying. When I saw a closely-knit group of friends, I felt afraid to join them, to break into their circle. Because more than anything else, I hated anyone thinking that I was a nuisance.\\r\\nBut then I began thinking about the relationships I had with people- those in which I felt comfortable, and those in which I felt uneasy, patronized, insecure. I realized that the relationships I felt most insecure in were those I formed when I first came to Korea five years ago- suspicious of the new surroundings, timid, and self-conscious. But with people I met later, when I was confident and had considerably more self-respect, I formed excellent relationships, in which I did not feel in the least intimidated or patronized. And I drew the conclusion that when I approached people with self-respect, people respected me.\\r\\nThis lesson is proving especially valuable as I start my new life in America.

In 1215, when absolute monarchy was prevalent in Europe, King John of England reluctantly signed this charter that clearly restricted and reduced the king’s powers.

The slaves served as a free labor force that greatly enhanced cotton industry and plantation in vast areas of America. However, slavery was also a major cause of the Civil War, the most devastating war in entire American history. The war itself left thousands of soldiers and civilians dead as well as the waste of billions of dollars consumed during and after the war. Slavery, a system accepted by Americans to strengthen their economy, turned out to be one of the greatest griefs that ruined America.\\r\\n          “King Lear” by William Shakespeare is another good example that shows one’s grief over his or her own mistake. Lear bequeathed his kingdom to his first two daughters. However, he purged his youngest daughter who refused to flatter him because she truly cared for her father. This mistake made Lear lose his mind as well as his youngest daughter, who ran to rescue him during the war. This tragedy by William Shakespeare clearly tells us that the greatest griefs are those that are committed by our own hands.\\r\\n          The last example showing one’s grief over one’s own misdeed is the pollution.

This land was first discovered and owned by the Russians. Failing to find anything profitable, Alaska was sold to US for seven million dollars. Americans however, found this land to be greatly lucrative in many natural resources such as coal and oil.

During this war both the US and the USSR strove against each other for the superiority over the nuclear weapons and space technology.

We base all our laws according to how it benefits our life; most people think that life is the most precious thing we have that cannot be endangered from other people. However, what do we have to do when we encounter murder? Do we have to execute the murderer? I do not agree. I do not think that the best protection from such crimes as murder is the death penalty for the following reasons. \\r\\n     \\r\\n     As I said above, our human lives are precious; they are the one thing God gave us as our own. Thus, it is a rightful duty for us humans, to greatly punish the murderer for taking another person's life. This is not refutable and is a definite thing to do. However, this does not mean that we can take the criminal's life. It would just be another act of murder. Do we repeat our problems to solve it? Well, the answer for this is definitely no.\\r\\n     \\r\\n     We should not  kill that criminal because it is also our absolute duty as freemen to give that person a chance to regret his or her crime. Let him or her think about himself again, and let him have the chance to grief over his act of evilness. Let him have a chance to change first. This is truly what a democratic society should do. It should not discard a criminal from society because he is dangerous to society; rather, it should change the criminal's attitude instead. \\r\\n\\r\\n     For example, in Korea, the serial killer Shin Chang Won, was regarded by our society as a man of the devil. He had kill about 10-20 people and had escaped from prison. But now, it has been discovered that he had been writing letters to a nun somewhere in Korea. Numerous letters from him were found in the nun's room. Surprisingly, most of the content was about how he thought he became a new person, and a kind one, too. It was undoubtable through these letters that he was regretting what he did in the past and sought to change himself. \\r\\n\\r\\n     Again, life is such a valuable thing to us that we do not have the right to judge whether another being should get the death penalty or not. It is a gift from God. It is invaluable. It should not be touched. Thus, when dealing with problems of life, we should tend to change that criminal's attitude instead of exectuting him and repeating the same mistake he did to the victim.

He was eventually caught after killing 10 people. The rifle which he used for the crime came from a weapon shop which did not report the missing rifle as required by the federal law. It was a natural consequence of maintaining loose gun control laws. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe current gun control laws have taken the lives of uncountable victims which fell prey to this loose murder weapon.

People say that everyone will have a laptop carrying everywhere they go. So I guess having a computer in the library will have an early computer education effect to the students. Students who didn’t know how to use computers (students who don’t have computers at home) may also learn how to use it by using computers at school with their friends. They could also use it for their school research assignments. It will surely be faster than skimming through the newspaper and the booklets. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn conclusion, I believe that buying computers for the library is much better choice than buying books. After all, students can read books from the internet as well. Only difference is that computer provides more amount of books in a small space.',\n",

       " (\"I agree that sometimes we learn the most from failure. In fact, it is the failure that teaches us to act differently the next time. This important lesson can be seen in Thomas Edison and the earthquake in Japan. \\r\\n\\tThe first example of learning most from failure is Thomas Edison. Everyone knows that he invented the light bulb, one of the most significant inventions in history. However, not many know that Edison had committed over couple of thousands of mistakes and gone through even more failures before completing his invention. It is these failures that conduced Edison to progress.\\r\\n\\tAnother example illustrating the benefits of failure is the earthquake in Japan. An earthquake that stroke Japan in 1923 killed over one hundred forty thousand people and is considered as one of the most horrific catastrophes in history. However, this disaster prompted Japanese to construct some of the most stable buildings in the world. Today, the buildings in Japan can withstand most of earthquakes and limit the number of casualties to a minimal degree. If it hadn't been for this failure, Japanese wouldn't have realized the need of constructing strong buildings against the earthquakes. \\r\\n\\tThe paragraphs above demonstrate that sometimes failure is more beneficial than success. It is the failure that gives us a greater opportunity to avoid the same mistakes. We must work to learn most from our failures so as not to repeat them.\",\n",

Their emotions get too upset that they can not express their feelings fully. However, I disagree with this statement. If you complain in person, you tell your points logically since you complain immediately after the poor service or a product has been received. Moreover, since you show all your unsatisfactory at once you get compensation at that time whereas if you write, you can not get a compensation of a poor service or a product you have received.  You will also be able to see the change they have made (if it was a poor service, the boss might change the person who was serving you and if it was the poor product, the shop or the restaurant may bring you a new dish/product).\\r\\n\\r\\nI also believe that complaining in person is of a better choice for the Koreans because Koreans have a rushing personally.

       " (\"I personally think that the tutor teachers should make a buddy, a student who has been to the school for a long time, to a new comer. This may help the students to feel more involved with the group of friends the buddy has. Buddy is a name given to a student who has been to the school for a long time. (He/she would take a new comer to classes and introduce her/his friends to a new comer)\\r\\n\\r\\nI personally had a buddy when I first moved to Australia. It was my first time moving to a new school, so I was very nervous. I was even more nervous since I am a type of a person who can not speak to a stranger before they speak to me. However, when my tutor made me a buddy, I felt very relieved and comfortable. All my buddy's friends talked to me since I was with her and my buddy always took me to classes and introduced me to her friends. Soon, I was familiar with all my buddy’s friends. My worry of being left alone was totally gone. \\r\\n\\r\\nOn the other hand, my friend has a very bad memory of moving a school. It was also her first time moving a school, so she must have been very nervous. Unlike my new school, however, her school didn’t make any buddy for her and in fact didn’t even take care of her properly. She used to tell me how lonely and sad she was at the new school. She sad it was very hard to talk to a stranger when they weren’t talking to her. So I think I was very lucky to have a buddy who took care of me well.\\r\\n\\r\\nNew comers always have a feeling that they will be left alone if they move to another school since students must have formed a close friend relationship between themselves already. Thus, it is hard to get into the group and be one of them. So I think it is clever and efficient for schools to make a buddy who has many friends and is very familiar with a school to take a care of a new student. By this, the student will make friends more easily and faster. She/he would also be familiar with a school fast since a buddy will take him/her to places and introduce them to her/him. Of course this won’t solve all the problems that the new comer will face when first moved to a new school but at least it will solve some friend issues. So I firmly believe that schools making a buddy to a new comer are a very good idea.\",\n",

Since he/she is so different from you, he/she must have different types of friends and interests from you. This can be both a merit and a defect. Since you experience and face new kinds of people, you may get to view things in a different point of view and experience new things. However, since you have different interests and opinions, you would tend to argue and fight with them often; you may as well not understand that person. This may lead to an end of a friendship and since I want a life-long friend, a friend who is different from me is not preferred as much as a friend who is similar from me. Since a person has similar interests and opinions, I would get along with her/him fine and share many things in common which will lead to a forever lasting friendship.\\r\\n\\r\\nI once had two best friends; one very similar from me and the other the opposite. I spend about 2 years with them and as the time passed, I realized that I preferred the friend who was similar from me rather than a friend who was different from me. I guess it was because I never shared anything in common with a friend who was different from me. With her, I was always arguing since we never had a same or even a similar opinion. Now, I only contact a friend who was similar from me. I feel comfortable and happy when I am with her. We have same taste in food and in fashion. So we have a great time shopping and eating together. Since we have a same taste, it's a great fun. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn conclusion, I prefer having a friend who is similar from me rather than a friend who is different from me.

It is a Korean custom for the eldest son or grand son to put rice into a dead person's mouth at his or her funeral. The rice signifies the food during the long journey to the heaven. All of family wept during the funeral, but what made us wail at the moment was that she had only a few teeth. If any, those were all worn and rotten. My great grand mother, who supported all of her five grand children after the death of my grand mother suffered from severe toothache before she passed away. She was very delighted when my father promised dental prosthesis for her. Before he fulfilled the promise, she had left us with those teeth and a handful of rice into her mouth. Among the wailing of people, making up a mind to be a dentist and take care of those people suffering from pains was the only thing I, an eleven-year-old girl, could do. \\r\\n\\r\\nAll I knew about dentistry was the simple technology of pulling teeth and treating caries at that time. Filling a decayed tooth looked the most advanced dental technology.  Fortunately, I could meet a dentist, a close friend of my father, who influenced my pursuit to be a dentist. He introduced me the vast exciting fields of dentistry. He explained the importance of the basic sciences related to dentistry to be a dentist. He said it is essential for a dentist to acquire fundamental knowledge and skills for the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of oral disease and apply the knowledge in solving clinical problems. He also stressed the social responsibility of dentist.\\r\\n\\r\\nA few years later, I had an opportunity to work as a laboratory assistant at Woo Song University. This experience gave me a chance to find out what I had to pursue in the dental field. The laboratory had carried out joint research on oral microorganism with a dental school. I could earn basic technology handling of microorganisms, but first and foremost I would like to value is the information (although it is much basic and limited,) about oral microorganisms. At first, I thought  microbiology and dentistry as separate fields.( or Microbiology and dentistry were separate fields to me at first.) But I was excited to realize that there are more than four hundred different kinds of oral microorganisms in our mouth, and they can cause not only many dental diseases but also many digestive diseases. It was a also stimulating fact that although the causes of dental diseases like teeth decay are well informed by many scientists, the area of therapy and prevention are not fully established yet.

TV shows and movies are made mainly for people leisure or interest. All the movie makers or show makers try to do is to make more people watch the show or a movie. In other words, some actions or situation in the show/movie are made only to interest people.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome people say that some TV shows or movies are educational. For example, Troy, the latest most popular movie about the ancient Rome shows the background and the history of Rome and how Roman acted and dressed up as. There are also some geographical channels, where people can learn about places, people who live there and the climate of various regions. Like so, some TV programs are very healthy and useful. The only sad fact is that there are more shows and movies that are very unrealistic and violent than the movies and shows which are educational and helpful.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost of the shows/movies are made with thousands and thousands of dollars and why do you think they put in so money? It’s because they want more profit. They say that if they put in great amount of money, it will make a lot of profit. Some may say that they are too monetary but in fact, the TV show/movie themselves are made to make profit by selling a laugh or a sorrow. It is one of the ordinary companies which are made to make profit. So it is not an obvious question that TV shows/movies are not educational nor have a good effect to its watchers. It is easy to make educational shows/movies, however it’s just that the movies makers and the TV show company are not willing to waste their money on the little profitable movie/show.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a recent research, it has been proved that teenagers tend to have a higher chance of smoking if they have seen smoking often before on the TV. \\r\\n\\r\\nSOme shows even offer a great amount of money to the winners of the show. The money is sometimes even greater than the amount of money the sallerymen earn every year.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor example, the Billionaire, the famous TV show gives a billion dollars to a winner of the show. This is very against the ordinary life of the people. Many people work for years to earn that amount of money, and to give it away to people that easily is just against the ordinary life people have.

I blieve it would be boring to have only one climate and enjoy only a limited sports,clothes and food. I am sure that no one would want to eat an ice-cream in Russia, during a freezing night and i am sure that no one have seen snow in malaysis so nover experienced ski before(that is if they never leaved malaysia).\\r\\nHowever, since korea has a definate for seasons, i can experinece many sports and clothes that many people can not in their countries. Koreans can ski, swim wear a mini-skirt to a woolen coat.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn conclusion I prefer living in areas with several climate changes a year. After all, people can not appreciata a warm, sunny day if it is always like that, I quess living imn an area with several climate changes gives me a chance to experience more things in a wider view.

In fact, it was found from the recent research that Kim chi is very helpful to cancer.\\r\\n\\r\\nKim chi has been passed down for generations without changing much of its taste.

It goes into nearly everywhere, from a soup to a hamburger, not mentioning eating it itself. \\r\\n\\r\\nEven with all these merits, Kim chi is not yet known to many foreigners.

Some may say that money is the most important aspect of a job since no one will be willing to work if they are not paid. However, I disagree with their opinion. Saying that money is the most important aspect of a job is like saying that the actor is the most important aspect of a movie. However, this is not true. No matter how popular and well known the actor is, if the scenario of the movie and the director of the movie are bad. Then the movie is unlikely to succeed.

This is nonsense.\\r\\n\\r\\nMoney is only paid to compensate the hard work a person did to a company not to make people work. In fact, there are many people who choose to have a low-paying job rather than a high-paying job. This suggests that people see a job more than just an income source. If not, everyone will want to have a high-paying job, wouldn't they? I believe doing something that I like for the rest of my life is more important and meaningful than the amount of paycheck I get.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn conclusion, I trust that money is not the most important aspect of a job.

       " (\"I have taken countless classes in various subjects, but what I learned that really helped me in life was something that I learned outside the classroom. When I was in the 3rd grade, I had taken swimming classes. In this class, I learned how to give mouth-to-mouth breathing, CPR, and other emergency procedures for reviving people who spent too much time underwater without oxygen. These classes continued until I gave up swimming in the 6th grade, and I thought that 'what's the use? It's not as if I'll get to save a drowining person'. But when my family moved to a small town with a river deep and clean enough for the kids to go swimming after dinner, i was proved wrong. \\r\\nFamous for its river that ran right through the middle, the town was a regular tourist attraction in the summer months of july and august. Despite it's fame, the town lacked elementary safety equipment and lifeguards for people coming to swim in the river. The city dismissed petitions to receive money for such safety procedures because the town was barely a hamlet on the edge of the countryside with a population of 347. Then one day, a couple of kids who were rash enough to jump into the river without kickboards or tubes or any other floating equipment almost drowned. An adult had fished the kids out of the strong currents, but the problem was CPR. No one in that town knew how to perform emergency respiratory procedures. I was 16 at the time and barely remembered how to do CPR, but as I started probing at the neck with my fingers to get the blockage out, it all came back to me, step-by-step, and  I successfully revived the two boys before the ambulance came. \\r\\nI hadn't realized until then just how valuable those years of CPR classes had been. Simply dismissing them as unpractical, I was impossibly bored and frustrated when my coach made me follow every step, every way. But I have come to realize that more valuable than any million-dollar lecture of any famous professor, were those CPR classes, where coach Kim sat with me persistently, making sure I knew what I was doing and knew it well enough to use it. This is a class i value to this day and will continue to do so.\",\n",

They are not only aware of usage of internet, but also the concept of whole computer matters. This means after couple decades, music CD economy will be extremely lost.\\r\\n On the other hand, new-concept on-line companies are arised. These companies, only few, provide software that we can download music files. There is new point, however, that it is not for free to download musics.

Finally, I put the book away and sought for other hilarious things to do. That’s what I usually do when I tried to read books about the history, the history of my home country, Korea. Although I was slightly interested in Korea’s history, the verbose and enigmatic words and sentences disrupt my zealous attention. \\r\\nI am proud of being a Korean and think it as a gift that I am distinct from other races. Sometimes, the endless barrier of language and manifest cultural differences made me to wish that I’d rather born as a native English speaker, but compunction and ponderous self-reflection always followed the immature disillusion. I didn’t read a lot of books which deal with Korea’s history; I just read the mandatory school text books and comic books which were made for entertaining rather than educational purposes. The utmost reason that makes me reminisce my vain pursuit of knowing profound and reverential history of Korea was the movie I watched a few weeks ago. The movie was about one of the famous battles while Korea was invaded by other stronger and wealthier countries. It was really inspiring and enlightening my ignorance of the history. Although the movie was basically based on entertainment, I could perceive the latent patriotism and loyalty of ancestors who sacrificed themselves to salvage and leave the better country for future generations. In order to fully understand the movie, I need fundamental knowledge on the history, but I should ask my friends about background information. Shame and self-criticism abruptly swept my mind, not because I had less knowledge than my friends but because I did not know how and what my antecedents strived to leave the better world for us. A famous Roman philosopher, Ciero said, “History is the witness that testifies to the passing of time; it illumines reality, vitalizes memory, provides guidance in daily life and brings us tidings of antiquity.” I should know and learn about the history, because they are not only the mystery of the past, but also the gift of the future. I unfold the book as the general, Kwan-Chang who fought mightily to protect the last castle and all other soldiers, generals and even people who willingly sacrificed themselves to protect the country.',\n",

       " (\"The most appropriate ways for people to show anger are these.\\r\\n First, it is to think of the things that make angry in mind and scream, or shout those anger out to outside of body. Shout as long as you want, until the angry person feel a fresh mind. This way no anger causes something bad results such as getting into argument and fight and occasionally damaging someone, but the angry person will feel much better after getting anger out of his body. Trying to put down anger inside and to bury deep in mind will turn to harmful influences to that angry person himself, simply turning to a person with a bad personaily or critic perception, or causing serious mental disease. But people need to control when they use this shouting method. For example, if you get angry in the night at your home or street wherever, you need to find sealed room or noisy place to shout, otherwise, you will wake neighbors up and make them angry. On the other hand, If you are at public place such as bank and store, I would recommend you to use bathroom to throw anger out. Sometimes it would be good idea to climb mountain and shout as much as you can on the top of hill.\\r\\n Second, there are two ways I would recommend for sudden anger. One of those two ways is to carry that little palm size sand pouch that is professionally made for anger. So whenever you suddenly get angry, you can knead the pouch as hard as you want, inside of your pocket. The sand pouch is so special that you do not need to worry about tearing or bursting it out. The other way is when you really get angry, to close your eyes, and to try think or imagine your own happy place or memory that make you reallly feel good. But you need to focus and concentrate to recall the happy image. If you don't have that kind of happy memory, you can always create the fantastic place. For example, you can imagine of scratching a million dollar lottery or you can imagine doing your favorite things.\\r\\n The best way is to try to face anger as advice or to think as a already passed past and think of mercy on it.\",\n",

Kim Il Sung of North Korea and President Bush.\\r\\n    Kim Il Sung founded a hermit empire that has remained obscured for more than half a centruy. The inside scope of this archaic country has been known to few until recently. As prying foreign policies illuminated the darkroom nation, it was clear that Kim held a unquestionable power over it. Yet this power enabled him not to run a nation, but simply to do what he wish. Kim's regime exacted laborers and citizens for his own pocket money while the rest of the nation went without so much as a single meal a day. When his nation started falling into an abysmal state of economic debacle, Kim did nothing to disencourage this catastrophe, choosing instead to lay back and indulge himself as ever. Also, Kim defiled his country by producing and selling arms on illegal markets, providing a chance for terrorist groups around the world to replete their arsenals. Kim is a dictator who is a clear example of a strong person who did everything he wished at the cost of millions.\\r\\n    President Bush, though honorable in his campaign to 'rid the world of terrorism', cannot turn away from the criticism that his war in Iraq was something done simply because he wanted to. By waging a war on unsteady grounds, the President 's unsage decision has displaced millions of refugees, killed innocent civilians as well as soldiers, and exacerbated the already taut diplomatic relations between former allies. He had also ignored advice from the United Nations and bullheadedly pushed forward his camapaign, acquiring acerbic castigations from the international community as a result. Bush is an example of the deadly consenquences that can happen when a strong person abuses the power he holds.\\r\\n    The strong should not act on their whims. Their power has been given by the people supporting them and the powerheads should act with gravity.

       " (\"The debate on the value of capital punishment has been incited ever since the institution of the Codes of Hammurabbi. To the minds of the ancient civilization, killing murderers for their deplorable crimes seemed logical. However, death penalty is not the most effective deterrent for crimes like murder. How can killing done by a government that prohibits murder be justified? How can more killing teach members of society not to kill? Death penalty is not an effective mean of aprising citizens of horror and vice of killing. Rather good education  and stable families will  prevent such heinous crimes from being committed. \\r\\n\\r\\nIf all the murderers in prison were properly educated from their youth, then they would not have committed such violent acts because education would have molded their ethics and conscience.  Most of the prisoners on death row are very poorly educated and are from urban or rural areas where proper education is not given. It is true that the ver y nature of these criminals may be violent and belligerent; however, history, literature, sciences, and arts would have shown them the value and fragility of life. Moreover, the only result of death penalty is ellimination of one murderer; education can prevent further developments of many murderers. Thus education is a better method of deterring people from killing than death penalty. \\r\\n\\r\\nStable family units are also necessar y to prevent murder from being committed. Humans are social animals. We develop our social skills, morals, and conscience within family. Considering the backgrounds of the criminals , it is perceptible thatt the majority of murders come from unstable, unhealthy families. This would have robbed them of learning experience and proper development of their own moral standards. Death penalty, on the other hand, does nothing but removes the dysfunctional member of society and does not remedy problems in family units. Therefore death penalty is not as effective as creation of stable family units in preventing further development of murderers. \\r\\n\\r\\nIt is indeed evident that proper education and stable family units develop people's ethics  and moral standards while death penalthy fails to do both. Education can apprise children and other members of society of the values of life. Stable family units can give children the opportunity to grow as functional members of society.  Thus in this age of segregation of suburbs and inner cities, it is imperative that governments around the globe implement proper education and advocate stable families to reduce murder rates and develop functional members of society to establish world peace.\",\n",

North Korea started the war to unficate the korea under the flag of communism. It was the progress of unification. Surely progress for one Korea is good and it is needed in present Korean peninsula.

Also if the unification progress was succeeded, the result may not be so positive. These days North Korea has a worse economic condition than South Korea. The unified communist Korea must not be different from the present North Korea because both will have same political system. So the progress by North Korea is negative.\\r\\n\\r\\n Chinese Cultural Revolution is another example of nagative progress. Mao, the first president of communist China, started the cultural revolution in 1960s to stronger the base of communist government and nationalism. The revolution emphasized the class conflict and destroying the inheritance of western and bourgeois culture. It was very abrupt change and progress. Many elites like doctors or professors were killed. Western cultural things like violins, pianos, records of Chopin and paintings of Monet were destroyed and burned. Because of the revolution, China lost its cultural variety. The revolution retrogressed the cutural development. Also the Chinese government later said the revolution was too revolutionary and failed. This revolution was surely a progress. But it brought negative results.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Through two examples of Korean War and Chinese Cultural Revolution, I proved that some progresses can cause regressions.

In Charles Dickens\\' masterpiece Great Expectations, the author shows benefits of lying that ultimately created everlasting relationship between Pip and Magwitch. During the World War II, many conscientious members of the German society and members of the diplomatic corps used lies to rescue the Jews from the horrendous clutch of Hitler\\'s S.S..  Schools teach children to lie in cases when their lives are endangered. Thus lying is not necessarily a vice, but rather if used wisely, it can be used to save lives of thousands of people and develop unbreakable relationships. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe benefits of lying are quite evident in Charles Dickens\\' mastepiece, Great Expecatations. In the novel, the protagonist Pip meets his clandestine benefactor, Magwitch, who is revealed as a fugitive prisoner from the penal colony of Austrailia. Although Magwitch was the antithesis of Pip\\'s vision of a gentlman of the Victorian society, Pip feels quite indebted to Magwitch thus offering him refuge at his own domicile. Because of Pip\\'s lies to the authorities regarding the location of Magwitch, Pip and Magwitch develop a burgeoning friendship that is tragically ended at the end of the novel. Thus Charles Dickens shows that lying can actually bond disparate individuals together and form relationships as strong as the one between Pip and Magwitch. \\r\\n\\r\\nWithout the lies and facade worn by many individuals under Hitler\\'s rule, thousands of Jewish people would have perished in Hitler\\'s diabolical concentration camps. One of the most prominent Germans who saved Jews from their possible deaths was Oskar Schindler, whose story was propagated by Steven Spielberg\\'s Schindler\\'s List.   By putting on the facade of forced labor in weapons factory, Schindler was able to rescue thousands of Jews from their deaths in gas chambers.  The Swedish diplomat to Germany also was able to rescue thousands of Jews from Germany. He gave Jews status as Swedish citizens, which of course were lies, and was able to bring them out of Germany and ship them to safe harbors in Britain and the United States.  It is thus evident that lies told by individuals such as Schindler and the Swedish diplomat were able to save lives and allow the survivors to continue on their culture. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn many schools, teachers inform their students to lie in circumstances  in order to be safe. For example, one of the dire circumstances that allows for lying is driviing under an influence. Teachers teach their students that if an aquantance who is not capable of driving because of drugs or alcohol, offers a ride, then the students should deny them by using \"white lies\"  Thus contemporary life requires , in certain situations . to lie to be safe from dangers. \\r\\n\\r\\nIt is clear that lying not only can develop relationships between people but also can save thousands of lives. By saving individuals from harms way through \"white lies,\" the bond  between the refugee and rescuer strengthens.  Thus although there may be some social taboos considered as vices, we must not forget that we can use the same vices to do good and contribute to society.',\n",

In fact, when people put criminals into the prison, they believe that putting criminals into the prison will reduce the crime rate. Many people say that the prison will reduce crime rate becuase they make cirminlas fearful. According to their opinion, once cirminals went to prison, won't commit crime again becuase they fear being in prison. But in my opinion, putting criminals into prison does not affect the crime rate.\\r\\n     Firstly, people put criminals into prision with a sense of revenge. Many people think that the criminals damaged them physically, metally, financially so they put criminals in to prison as a revenge. But a revenge doesn't make criminlas to acknolwedge their wrongdoing and not to commit crime again. Criminals often have a tendency to commit a crime again becuase they were 'revenged' by their victims, and upset, even angry about it.\\r\\n     Secondly, prisons don't have the program or system to enlighten them not to commit crime. In prison, prisoners often work physically. There is no system to prevent their possible further crime. Without the system or program to educate them, no one can be sure wheter they will commit crime when they come out of the prsion. People should establish programs to educate the criminlas in prison  rather than just putting criminals into prison in order to prevent further crimes.\\r\\n     Thirdly, most of the crimes break out becuase of poverty. They steal other people's property becuase they don't have any money or food to live on. In this case, just putting those cirminlas into the prsion won't help prevent further possible crimes because when the poor criminals come out of the prison, they are likely to commit crime again becuase they don't have anything to live on. People should try to develope social welfare if they want to keep this kind of people from commiting a crime.\\r\\n     Finally, unlike many people's common belief, putting criminlas into the prsion won't help preventing further possible crimes because sence of revenge won't be a solution, the prison itself does not have the program to enlighten the criminals not to commit crime again, and most of the crimes break out becuase of the criminal's poverty. Rather putting criminlas into the prison, the society have to muse on why crimes break out and how to prevent them permanantly,\",\n",

       " (\"Tobacco was first introduced to the world as a profitable crop when the British Empire colonized the eastern coast of North America.  Since then, tobacco industry has become one of the most profitable industries of world economy.  As the industry expanded, lung cancer became more significant as a lethal disease.  Because of tobacco's addictiveness, the popularity of cigarette continues to either expand or remain largely wanted.  Since it is the government's duty to protect its citizens from self-endangerment, cigarettes should be made illegal because their health hazards to both the smokers and by-standers. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe effects of tobacco on human lungs are quite well known to be extremely detrimental; consequently, the sale of cigarettes should be made illegal or largely reduced to lower death rates due to smoking. The most prominent example of such health hazard is lung cancer. The tobacco plant is unhealthy both to the soil and human body. During its growth, the plant requires a large amount of nitrogen to survive and unlike other plants, does not return any nitrogen back to the soil. Thus, tobacco plants are detrimental to the environment. Cigarettes are also notorious for their carcinogens, cancer- causing chemicals. Consequently, many smokers eventually die from lung cancer. Moreover, second-hand smokers, people who breathe the air contaminated with cigarette smoke, are endangered by tobacco. Therefore, because of environmental and health detriments caused by tobacco, cigarettes should be illegal . \\r\\n\\r\\nTobacco should be illegal, for it is the duty of any government to protect its citizenry from danger.  The U.S. government of all levels requires bikers to wear helmets, drivers to buckle up, and skaters to wear protective devices. Then there is no reason for the government not to outlaw cigarettes in order to protect the health of its citizens. States like California and New York forbid smoking in public areas and indoors to protect their citizens. Also the U.S. government outlaws any handling of illegal drugs such as marijuana and cocaine because these drugs can be extremely addictive and physically detrimental to the body. Tobacco counts as a drug, for it is addictive and carcinogenic. It is also illogical for the government to ban carcinogens in most industries and still allow tobacco products, the most accessible form of carcinogen, to be sold. Thus, the government has every reason to outlaw tobacco. \\r\\n\\r\\nIt is indeed evident that cigarettes should be outlawed because of their health hazards and a government's duty to protect its citizens.  If people stopped smoking, our society could save 169,500 people per year.  It is also illogical for a government to make laws that force us to protect ourselves and not prohibit smoking. Although outlawing tobacco can be unfavorable for the economy, it is far better to save people who can be active consumers  than to let people hurt themselves with such cumulatively harmful substance.\",\n",

Being an elementary schoool student, the amount of pressure and nervousness I felt was immense.

But because I always held to the belief that my performance would be helpful to others, the pressure would lift off of my shoulders when I performed.\\r\\n     When my performance ended, the audience applauded wildly. They were impressed that such a little boy had the endurance to play a long solo piece (The piece I played was a rondo by W.

After the whole performance was over, I asked some of the audience if my playing really were helpful. \"Of course,\" an old lady told me, \"I haven\\'t heard such good music played by a little boy.\" and pat my head. My effort through learning a musical instrument had paid off.\\r\\n     Of the many things I learned in life, I value my learning of playing the saxophone the most. It has been helpful to me because of the fact that I had acquired another ability, but more importantly, it has helped others, especially my audience--those who crave for music.',\n",

Ultimately, these powerfigures put Kim through agonizing physical and mental torture and dragged him out of politics. Yet Kim's cloudy days were interwoven with a silver lining when he was elected president by popular vote.

People apt to think that death penalty will decrease the amount of crimes because they have a function as a warning. Bu putting a criminal into a death penalty, other criminals won't commit serious crimes anoymore because they are afraid of being put to death. This is what most of the people believe to be true. But in my opinion, death penalty is of no use to prevent further crimes.\\r\\n     Firstly, death penalty is a kind of revenge to criminals. Revenge doesn't do any good. In fact, it produces more revenge. People need to understand why those criminals had to commit such serious crime and try to forgive them. Only love and forgiveness will bring people peace.\\r\\n     Secondly, people tend to believe that death penalty can be a  useful because they show other criminals that when they commit a serious crime like that, they can also be put into death. But this doesn't stop criminlas from commiting a serious crime such as homicide or rape. Most of the times, criminlas don't think about what will happen next. Punishing these people with death penalty is too harsh. We have to punish them with other sentences such as life imprisonment or social service.\\r\\n     Thirdly, serious crimes doesn't happen to come out without any reason. There can be two aspects: personal problem and social problem. Seen from the Yoo Young-Chul, who killed 21 people in South Korea, didn't kill those people just because he was mentally ill, but the South Korea society also had a problem. This murder was occured also because the South Koreans didn't distribute their wealth. The judgement that put Yoo-Young-Chul into death penalty can be biased because it only saw the murder was matter of the murderer himself.\\r\\n     To conlcude, death penalty cannot prevent further henious crimes because the death penalty itself has a strong meaning of revenge to the criminla, criminlas don't fear death penalty when they commit crime, and such heinous crimes cannot be thought only as a criminal's problem. Rather, the society should learn to forgive the criminals and try to make the society itself a better place to live.\",\n",

Bush's grandiose campaign involved international troops, technicians and medics, yet the results are doing little to satisfy the relevent nations and some are even casting doubt on the legitimacy of the war itself. Millions of dollars have been squandered in a still success-sterile warfare, casualties-civilian as well as military-are rising by folds each day, and already taut diplomatic relations with once allies are on the breaking point. Indeed, President Bush's war in Iraq is an unjustified wager with too much losses and too little gains.\\r\\n     The U.S.'s war against Vietnam was another circumstance that is unjustifiable. Seeking to uproot a communist regime in the nation, America waged a war that seemed bleak from the start.

The method of wiping out the jungle with a acrid chemical by the name of agent orange also served to affect the veterans with severe physical disorders, some even passing on to the next generation.

Some claim that Intellectual property is not like material property, and it can't be protected under the law. But in my opinion, intellectual property must be protected under the law just like material property because intellectual property has a lot in common with material property.\\r\\n     Firstly, intellectual property has to be protected because it took a great effort to gain it. One may think that Intellectual property is not needed to put a lot of effort in it, but actually it takes a lot of effort to gain intellectual property. For example, Bill Gates made the Windows, an operational system. Microsoft made a lot of effort to complete it. Microsoft made 2 versions of Windows, which turned out to be a total failure. Bill Gates even thought once thought about giving up developing windows. After all, he succeeded to make the most successful operating system ever. Now, windows is protected under the law as a intellectual property. This can be seen as in many countries, including the United States, recognize the importance of intellectual property and therefore protects it.\\r\\n     Secondly, intellectual property is the driving force of the modern society. If a society doesn’t protect intellectual property, the society can’t have any developments. One will not work hard to gain a intellectual property because he/she knows that what they gain from working that hard can’t be protected at all. Today’s world is called the information society. It is crucial to own a lot of intellectual materials in order to succeed in this society. The quality and quantity of intellectual materials a society has determines the strength the society has in the world. So, it is strongly demanded that intellectual property must be protected under the law.\\r\\n     To conclude, intellectual properties must be protected under the law because it has taken great effort to gain the intellectual property and it is one of the most crucial driving powers of the society. If the law does not protect the intellectual property, one will not try hard to gain intellectual property, which will eventually turn out to be no good not only to him/her, but also to the society that he/she consists of.\",\n",

No such a big group had crossed the Alps. But Hannibal crossed the Alps despite the danger because he could go to Rome without any resistance of Roman Army. No Roman had expected that Hannibal would cross the Alps. Though many soldiers and almost all elephants died, his troops appeared in front of Rome with great suprise and almost annahilated Roman troops. \\r\\n\\r\\n  Also Che Guevara made great decision in his life despite danger. He was a medical student in Argentina. After graduation, he could be a doctor that has a secure life. Doctors are welcomed and respected in everywhere throughout the world. But Che Guevara didn't became a doctor. He abandoned the sucure and easy life. Instead, he went to Cuba and led the Cuban Revoultion with Fidel Castro. Being revolutionist was surely more dangerous than living as a doctor. If the revolution had failed, he could have caught and been killed. Or he could die during the combat. But he braved those dangers because he really wanted the revolution. After the success of revolution, he became the brain of the post-revolution Cuban government.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Above two heroes, Hannibal and Che Guevara, became famous and respected because they made great decisions giving up safety and security.

But he never became the president with coup or rebel. He became the president and made Nazis the major party through legal way. His speeches and his policies appealed the German people who were depressed after the defeat of World War II. So majority of German citizens supported Nazis.

Majority made false decision by choosing Nazis and Hitler.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Also people's courts in communist nations are the case in which majority is not wise.

So after the communist revolution, there are people's courts to deal with so-called anti-revoultionary people, who were mostly former aristocrats, bourgeois and elites. In people's courts, there were more people who could decide the punishment than judges. So mob's ill feeling toward a man could lead him to death penalty though he was guilty in actual law.

It was based on the concept of an eye for an eye and of unequal punishment among the classes, the lowest classes receiving harsher punishment than the upper ones. For example, a rich man who committed murder would pay fine while a poor man had to be enslaved or killed after committing the same crime. In this manner, the richer could lighten their punishments and be advantageous over the poor. \\r\\n\\tThe next example illustrating an inequality of the law between the rich and the poor is the background of the French Revolution in 1789. At that time, the law acknowledged discrimination among the classes. For instance, the law protected the rich and allowed them to be exempt of tax while it levied great amount tax to the poor. Such inequality eventually aspired the French peasants to riot and put down the law nad the government that neglected them. \\r\\n\\tThe paragraphs above tell us that sometimes the law disregards the poor and benefits the rich. The earliest law code as well as one of the most influential revolutions proves my opinion.

To avoid responsibility matters, the patients themselves should have make the judgment regardless of what is right or wrong for how their death would affect its surroundings. Because it is the patient himself/herself who makes the choice and takes the heavy burden that is called responsibility, the medical personnel in charge should respect the patient\\'s decision.\\r\\n     It is undoubtable that euthanasia shortens a patient\\'s life. However, if it is for the good and peaceful death of a patient, this should be permitted. In common sense, everyone would like to die in a peaceful state rather than pure torture up until the very last second. If the doctor decides it is better off for his/her terminally ill patient to die, that would of course be intentional murder. However, the decision is from the patient, not the doctor. When the patient is a properly thinking person under a painfully hopless illness, his/her decision to die should not be left ignored (If the patient is in a vegetative state, the patient should no doubt be left alive). It is not us who endure the unbearable pain but the patients, and their hope of dying should not be considered simply as a lack of endurance. Being forced to live a life that is imminent to death and bears an ineffable amount of pain is also a kind of repression towards freedom. It is the patient\\'s freedom to choose to die a sound death.\\r\\n     Euthanasia can be called a kind of suicide, but should not be treated as the same kind of suicide regular people commit just because of severe depression. For terminally ill people, their death is already a reserved event and some have to go through excessive pain until their death. These patients choose to die an easy  and painless death, and regardless of morality issues, it is the freedom of the patient to make that decision, not through compulsion of living a little longer.',\n",

Genetic testing, with the advancements made in biotechnology, can now apprise prospective parents of their genotype and possible genetic makeup of their offspring. Such testing can determine if any of the parents is a carrier of genetic diseases such as Huntington’s or sickle anemia.

This becomes crucial when one considers the possibility of passing on genes for genetic diseases. For example, Huntington’s disease is a genetic disease regardless of gender that results in slow deterioration of the nervous system and ultimately death. If one of the parents has the gene that causes Huntington’s, the parents’ children will have fifty percent chance of being afflicted with such disease. This disease, whose onset does not begin to affect the afflicted individual until ages beyond thirty-five, can cause much pain and suffering for the family and posterity. Thus, prospective parents should be influenced by genetic testing in order to ensure happiness and healthy lives for their children. \\r\\n\\r\\n              Even with non-fatal diseases such as sickle cell anemia, it is crucial for the parents to know the possibility of passing on the genes that cause such diseases to their children to provide effective medical attention. Sickle cell anemia is a homozygous recessive disease, which means that an individual afflicted with the disease must have two genes that cause the disease. However, even if both parents are carriers of this gene, there is only twenty five percent chance of producing a child with sickle anemia. Moreover, because of the improper formation of the afflicted individual’s blood cells, the afflicted individuals need medicine and professional assistance to lead healthy lives. Thus it is indeed important for the parents to know their own genotype to predetermine the possible genetic structure of their children and plan to provide medical assistance if necessary. \\r\\n\\r\\n               It is indeed that prenatal and carrier testing should be utilized to apprise prospective parents of possible genetic diseases that can afflict their children. As parents, it seems better to provide a healthy life to a child than to give life to a child afflicted with a disease that will cause much pain and suffering for both the child and parents and eventually consume the child within mere three to five years. Genetic testing also can reveal problems with children that need to be treated with professional assistance. Therefore, genetic testing allows for the prospective parents to plan carefully to begin a family and provide their children with the optimal life that they indeed deserve.',\n",

Many people who did not reach enlightenment from age, such as Buddha and Thoreau, can be seen throughout history. They, apparently, did not require age in order to find the truth they were seeking.\\r\\n     Shakamuni Buddha was born in ancient India as the first-born prince of a mighty kingdom. The intelligent boy grew up lavished with a multitude of physical comforts. Nonetheless, he soon gave up all earthly pleasures (including the promised crown) in order to attain enlightenment. Through practicing many kinds of asceticism, he finally realized that the only thing blocking him from enlightenment was his obsession with his goal.

The stronger nations always had superior positions to negotiate treaties, trades, and cultural exchanges.  Dystopian novels clearly exhibit the futile war between the non-conformists and oppressive regimes.  Even on the atomic level, the larger atom, the larger molecule determines the structure or function of the molecule or atom. Therefore, the statement regarding the relationship between the strong and weak is veracious.\\r\\n\\r\\n               The tyranny of the strong over the weak is quite evident throughout the span of human history.  The most prominent example is the reign of the British Empire during the nineteenth century.  Although Britain had lost its territorial claim below the forty second longitudes in North America, its industrialization and infamous navy were instrumental in expanding the reign of the British crown over Africa and Asia. In Africa, British forces competed against other European powers to control Egypt, central Africa, and South Africa. Within those territories, Britain ruled as it wished regardless of the will of its subjects or colonists. For example, in South Africa, Dutch colonists known as the Bohrs offered much resistance against the encroachment of the British government in their lands. This conflict led to the Bohrs War in South Africa in which the British forces created the world’s first concentration camps where Bohr captives suffered starvation and harsh treatments. Thus the history of the British Empire clearly shows that the strong can do as it wishes regardless of the will or suffering of the weak. \\r\\n\\r\\n              In many dystopian novels, it is clear that the stronger society is able to break the wills of its dissident members. In George Orwell’s 1984 (should be underlined), Wilson, the protagonist, grows weary of the restricted life of Oceania, one of the superpowers of the world in the novel. As his dissatisfaction with the regime led by Big Brother grew, so did the efforts made by the government to remedy this dysfunctional member of the society. Wilson makes some acquaintances with other dissidents. However, they are eventually arrested by the Ministry of Truth or Minitruth to be rehabilitated back into society. Despite Wilson’s dogmatic views of the oppressive government of Oceania, the suffering that the character witnesses within the ministry is sufficient to make him pliable to the standards of society. Therefore, it is clear in the work by George Orwell that the strong party, in this case the government, can do as it wishes to maintain its power and hold on the will of the mass public.\\r\\n\\r\\n               Even in chemistry, it is evident that large molecules control the structure and function of the larger whole regardless of the presence of a multitude of smaller bodies. In proteins, the primary level of structure is a linear sequence of amino acids. The second level of structure is a helix or pleated plates. As the structure of a protein becomes more three dimensional, the role of strong bonds like cystine bonds between sulfur molecules becomes more significant. If such bonds were supplanted by weaker hydrogen bonds, the structure of the particular protein would become drastically different from its original structure, which can affect the function and efficiency of the protein with equal significance. Also a molecule’s polarity or inequality in charges is determined by the number and location of large atoms such as fluorine or other ionic molecules. Because these are larger atoms, electrons from other smaller atoms are transferred to these bodies hence making them more negative than other smaller atoms. Thus, it is evident that even in the atomic world, larger, stronger bodies determine the structure and function of smaller bodies. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\t      The statement that the strong do what they wish is quite true as seen in history, literature, and science. Larger nations can utilize their powers to compel their smaller allies or peripheries to act as they wish. In dystopian literature, the stronger, larger society triumphs over the small, disorganized resistance group of non-conformists. Moreover, in science, large atoms and molecules trump smaller ones and determine the structure and function of the whol e.

The founders reasoned that by giving scholars and inventors the right to own their creations, the United States would become a sanctuary for intellectuals who can be rewarded for their contributions to the betterment of humanity. And rightly so, should inventors and scholars given the right to own their intellectual property.  These intellectuals have spent months, years, and even their entire lives to develop their property. Therefore, intellectual property should be protected by the government and consumers should respect the creators' rights to their products. \\r\\n\\r\\nIt would be truly inequitable if intellectual properties are not protected under the law. Scenarios in which inventors were not given the rights to their own creations are innumerable in history. The most prominent example is Gutenberg's printing press. Because the Catholic Church and ruling authorities strictly controlled the flow of intellectual works in Europe, any innovations in information technology were either destroyed or confiscated. Gutenberg thus was compelled to keep his invention confidential from society and work cautiously, only fulfilling orders from credible consumers. Despite his revolutionary invention, Gutenberg was not always credited with the invention of the printing press. His wine business partner initially took the credit for inventing the printing press. This injustice was remedied only after the death of Gutenberg. Thus, from Gutenberg’s example, it is evident that the injustice of intellectual thievery should be prevented from occurring to reward those individuals who contributed to society. \\r\\n\\r\\nAnother reason for protecting intellectual property is that such protection attracts more intellectuals to flock to a society in which their works are equitably rewarded. The brain drain from European and Asian countries to the United States occurs because the intellectual properties of pundits and scientists are recognized very quickly in America. Because the protection of intellectual properties is explicitly written in the constitution of the United States, the U.S. government can give patents more expediently than other European or Asian countries. Moreover, such congregation of intellectuals is quite beneficial to the economy of the United States. Nowadays there are much discussions regarding outsourcing of American jobs including those in high technology fields. These debates arise because the effect of intellectual properties is quite profound in the United States. Therefore, governments should protect intellectual properties with legislations and power of the executive branch of the government.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the examples in history and current economy, it is indeed evident that intellectual properties should be protected under laws and encouraged by society. Pilfering or illegally profiting from intellectual properties of others truly is unjust for the creators who have invested their time and efforts in their works. In addition, intellectual property is a crucial component of economy of many industrial nations including the United States. The debate on pirating music or movies is not on the fact that intellectual properties should not be protected but on the fact that big corporations exploit their rights to gain gargantuan profits.

The main character, Jean Valjean, is a young man who is suddenly laid off from work. The poor youth, desperate to feed his starving nephews and nieces back home, cannot help breaking into a bakery in the dead of night to steal a loaf of bread. However, the local gendarmes neither have mercy nor let him go free. Although his cause is pitiable, Jean Valjean ends up in jail; however laudable his cause, society\\'s treatment of Valjean\\'s actions shows that his course of action was unacceptable.\\r\\n     The example of Evita Peron also illustrates how unacceptable means cannot be justified by the consequences. After Mrs. Peron became the First Lady of Argentina, she enacted a massive welfare reform in order to save the uneducated, unclothed, and starved Argentinians. Nonetheless, careless budgeting and neglect of other equally crucial issues led the country to quickly go broke; Mrs. Peron had won the public\\'s support and lost all else. The \"Angel of Charity\" also dressed extravagantly, whose sense of fashion pleased the people but also contributed enormously to the collapse of the economy. Mrs. Peron tried to alleviate the troubles of the public, but her inappropriate methods resulted in even more instability and chaos.\\r\\n     Good causes by themselves are perfectly desirable; the morally bad or illegal means to achieve them are, in any case, not. When laudable ends are gained by proper means, we will have truly made the world a better place.',\n",

       " ('People in general have materialistic desires. It is hard to find anyone who doesn\\'t want money, fame, power, or a combination of these. Yet, there do exist some people who have done seemingly altruistic things in order to pave the way for a better society. However, examples from history and current events show that these people often act from selfish motives as well.\\r\\n     Recently, a piece of heartwarming news was revealed. An old woman making a living by doing menial labor donated a million dollars, her entire life savings, to a university to established a scholarship fund for intelligent students who would otherwise be unable to afford higher education. She was quoted in a magazine interview as saying that \"she had only done what she had had to do, so please don\\'t make a big fuss about nothing.\" At first glance, the old woman might seem to be a rare example of selfless altruism. However, a closer look makes one wonder why the benefactress did not choose to make the donation anonymously if she truly desired to remain unknown. Her eager acceptance of numerous newspaper interviews also showed that the old woman had had  fame as well as goodwill in mind.\\r\\n     Abraham Lincoln, who is known as the \"Great Emancipator,\" is another person to have ulterior motives behind a well-masked facade. While it is true that Lincoln was strongly opposed to slavery in principle, he had no desire to push for the abolition of slavery. The seven southern states who seceded from the Union when they heard that Lincoln had been elected president because they feared his opposition of slavery being translated into legislation had assumed wrongly. In the contrary, Lincoln - as a pragmatist - was of the mind to keep slavery because it was too deeply rooted in the American society to eliminate. In fact, the \"Emancipation Proclamation\" that Lincoln is so famous for was declared after the Civil War had already started; the president was simply trying to weaken the force of his enemies rather than upholding the basic rights of man.\\r\\n     Some opponents advocating the other side of the issue mention examples of unconditional charity such as Mother Teresa to prove their point. However, people such as she and Buddha were beyond the state of desiring anything except the well-being of mankind. These people were, in fact, not human anymore in their thoughts; therefore, the general restrictions applied to humans did not apply to them. If people were motivated more strongly by conscience than by material gains, neither would donations be newsworthy nor the millions of modern patents exist. Martyrhood and sainthood are fine enough, but in reality, people tend to value survival and thus materialistic values more than altruistic ones.',\n",

       " (\"This year is the sixteenth anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre in China.  A group of students, who were peacefully protesting the Chinese government's oppressive regime, was run over by tanks and killed by salvos from the Chinese military. Commemorating this event, recently on the National Public Radio, there was an interview regarding “the Great Firewall of China,” a government-funded regulation system of all internet access within the People’s Republic of China. The interviewees described the ways in which the Chinese people could evade the omnipresent censorship of the government through metaphors and literary devices. This implicit protest against censorship can be also seen in many versions in history and dystopian novels. It is also illogical for democratic governments that promote free speech to restrict the rights of their citizens to view materials on the Internet. Therefore, there must not be any censorship or regulation of any kind on the contents on the Internet. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe first case of the public protest against censorship in American history can be seen in John Adams’s administration. Because of an escalating tension between Napoleon’s France and the newly formed republic in America, the Adams administration and the White House-friendly Congress passed the Alien and Sedition Acts in 1798, an act tantamount to modern day’s P.A.T.R.I.O.T Act that restricted any criticism of the president and his cabinet and gave the executive branch the right to deport individuals who were accused of disloyalty to the state. Outraged by this apparent violation of the Constitution, the Anti-Federalists, the opponents of John Adams and led by Thomas Jefferson, began a national campaign to abolish this act. The public in response voted for the Anti-Federalists and their platform and John Adams’s presidency ended in 1800. Thus from this example, it is evident that in a democratic society, there will be a citizenry that will respond to any restrictive measures taken by its government in order to protect its rights. Therefore, there must not be any regulation on the materials on the Internet because such restriction of freedom will be futile and met with much public dissatisfaction. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn dystopian novels, the effects of government regulation on media clearly show why there should not be any censorship on media. In George Orwell’s “1984,” the government of Oceania, one of the three supernations of the world, controls every aspect of news, education, and art to which its citizens are exposed. The state-controlled news compels the public to live under a constant fear of war between the supernations. The glorification of the Big Brother and his party brainwashes the entire society to be loyal to the state. Winston Smith, the protagonist of the novel, breaks away from that mold and gradually discovers a clandestine society of dissidents. Despite his efforts to be free, the Ministry of Truth uses propaganda, torture, and psychological manipulation to transform Winston into another conformist. Thus government regulation of the media, especially a source of information like the Internet, must not happen because it will, like in “1984,” deprive the public of an opportunity to produce individuals and unique voices.  \\r\\n\\r\\nProponents of regulation on the contents on the Internet may argue that such censorship can limit the spread of propaganda of groups like the Neo-Nazi groups or Al Qaeda; however, the government, if it imposes such regulations, is not protecting freedom and democracy but playing at the same level as the very enemies of liberty. The founders of the United States, although held Hobbesian view of human nature, gave much credit to the human desire to be free by passing the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. On the Internet, the public can access a myriad of fictional and factual information; but, it is the responsibility of the public to determine the validity and morality of materials viewed and to make its own decision. In addition, unaltered images of bigoted groups like the Neo-Nazis or Al Qaeda can show the malice and injustice of their propaganda. Therefore, by not interfering or restricting access to certain materials on the Internet, the government will not only foster democracy and freedom but also depict the true nature of bigotry and xenophobia. \\r\\n\\r\\nThus it is indeed evident that there should not be any censorship or regulation on the contents on the Internet. As history has shown, any citizen of a democratic society will revolt against such measures that restrict his or her rights. The authors of dystopian novels also illustrated the effects of such censorship of the media in their works: people will lose their individuality; the entire society will function according to one philosophy; the society will lose its humanity. It is indeed illogical for a democratic government to restrict the rights of its citizens in order to protect them from the enemies of freedom. Thus we must indeed remember the words of Ray Bradbury who said the true enemy of freedom is not burning of books but making people to stop reading books.\",\n",

The examples that show this important lesson are the Hundred Year’s War and “Romeo and Juliet” by William Shakespeare.\\r\\n\\tOne example that shows a wise decision by compromising is the Hundred Year’s War during the 14th and 15th centuries. The British beat the French at major battles and invaded large portion of France. At that time, Joan, a young peasant girl, who told that she heard the God’s message to fight the British, requested the King Charles to let her lead his army. During those days, when women were considered inferior to men, it was unimaginable for a young peasant girl to lead the army during the War. However, King Charles, who initially rejected Joan’s request, changed his mind and authorized her as the chief commander of French army. Fortunately, Joan of Arc won many battles and drove most of the British out of her country. King Charles made a wise decision by compromising to Joan and saved the country. \\r\\n\\tAnother example that illustrates a wise decision made by changing one’s mind is “Romeo and Juliet” by William Shakespeare. Although Romeo and Juliet strongly loved each other, their families had a very hostile relationship. Both families were strongly reluctant to compromise to their children. This firm persistence led Juliet to trick her family by pretending to be dead, which unfortunately tricked her lover and made him commit suicide. If the families had changed their minds and allowed Romeo and Juliet to be together, they wouldn’t have needed to grieve over their children’s death.\\r\\n\\tThe paragraphs above tell us that sometimes compromising or changing mind is a good idea. Although considered a virtue, having the courage of one’s convictions may be harmful. We must keep in mind that not only sticking to our convictions but also changing our minds help us make a wise decision.',\n",

Still, they generally agree that their grief is greater when they themselves have caused it. As shown plainly in a recent movie as well as personal experience, self-caused sorrows seem magnified because people feel that they had the ability to prevent the sad event from happening, regardless of whose fault it was.\\r\\n     In a recently released movie called \"Save the Last Dance,\" the main character, Julie, has given up her dream of becoming a ballerina because of her mother\\'s death in a car accident. She believes that her insistent that her mother attend Julie\\'s audition for a ballet school resulted in her mother\\'s speeding and therefore hasty death. If the accident had occurred without any relation to the ballet part of the story (e.g. the mother had been killed in a car accident while driving to the supermarket), Julie would neither have felt so much guilt nor have been compelled to give up her only dream. However, as the situation stood, she had no one to blame but herself, consequently leading to her abandonment of ballet.\\r\\n     Another example comes from personal experience. One day in school, I was playing \"Guess the Card\" with my classmates. We split into two teams, and one member of a team had to pantomime what the card he was holding said while the other members tried to guess the card. I got so excited by the game that I lost track of which team was playing when, and kept guessing out of turn out loud. Our team had been originally winning, but the other team caught up fast. Finally, we were tied; if the other team managed to win a certain number of points, our team would lose. After the other team started guessing, I realized a clue they had missed and shouted it out loud in my excitement. Alas! Thanks to me, the other team plainly heard what I had said and quickly figured out what the card said. The other kids on my team glared at me menacingly, and I had no choice but to meekly smile an apology. If the other team had solved the mystery by itself, I would not have felt as gulity and sorry as I had then. (I happen to have a competitive streak.) However, since I was the one who had unwittingly committed suicide for my team, I could only bite my tongue and wish I had been a little less enthusiastic.\\r\\n     Some say that griefs that they had no say in make them extremely sad. However, losing a dog in a car accident where it willfully jumped into the street will probably seem like nothing when compared to losing a dog by its getting hit by a car while chasing a ball the owner commanded it to fetch. In the former case, the accident could not have been avoided. In the latter, one\\'s command not issued would have been enough to save the poor dog from mortality. Thus, it is easy to see that the greatest griefs are those we cause ourselves.',\n",

       " (\"Throughout the history of biological lifeforms, it can be seen that human beings are one of the very few species which have a diet composed of both meat and plants, because eating foods from both sides give a balance in nutrition. The importance of meat is obvious: meat is a high-calorie diet, and it is a much better source of protein than vegetables. However, as humans have always, in the past, relied more on raising crops than livestock, meat isn't an absolute necessity in our diets. Also, the recent increase in vegetarians proves that our dependence on meat is ever decreasing.\\r\\n     In the very start of the history of human beings, we used to live very nomadic lives. The only means of obtaining food were hunting and gathering. Hunting was an effortful task, and the meat usually didn't last long enough compared to fruits and vegetables, so meat proved to be a less reliable source of food. Until livestock was domestically raised, meat was an extreme scarcity, and most people didn't even have a chance to eat meat for their whole lives. On the other hand, after farming was known to civilization, yielding crops became the predominant business. Our historical reliance on yielding crops indicates that it was not really a human being's nature to be a carnivore.\\r\\n     While most of us humans enjoy eating meat, it is blatant that we can't survive just by eating meat. In fact, a diet entirely composed of meat is a threat to a person's health. As people (especially in developed countries) become more aware of the problems related to only eating meat, vegetarians are becoming a boom in the society. These people survive through diets composed entirely of vegetables, and generally have almost no health problems compared to meat eaters. Vegetarians are totally autonomous from eating meat, and this clearly proves that human beings can be herbivores, too, without any kind of consumption of animal flesh.\\r\\n     As seen historically in both the past and present, it is not our natural tendency to eat flesh. We have always depended more on plants than animals as a source of food. Also, the recent boom in the number of vegetarians strongly indicates that for some, it is human nature to abhor meat.\",\n",

At that time, Kang organized the labor union of players and became the representative. He claimed the players' demands as a representative and leader of the union. He was really courageous. Soon he was released from his team and no team accepted him. The reason was that All chairmen of the teams agreed not to accept him and to kick him out of the professional baseball. He became a MC of TV program because he was popular and he couldn't play baseball any more. And after his retirement from baseball, the players and chairmen reached the compromise. Though the conflict was solved, Kang was forgotten by people and noboby remembered him as a hero despite his courage.\\r\\n\\r\\n  President Roh of South Korea was a famous lawyer before he became politician.

Examples from numerous cases in history well illustrate the position.\\r\\n     Napoleon Bonaparte\\'s conquering rage through the European continent was indeed dynamic, but did not last for long. Although the French people was initially impressed with the Corsican general\\'s heroic image, they quickly tired of his war-mongering attitude and ever-changing whims. This is why the former emperor of France was forced to abdicate twice, finally living a lonely life in exile until his death in 1821. If he had chosen to take things slowly to convince the people that he was the man for the job, perhaps the people would not have been so antagonistic to his policies.\\r\\n     The perestroika program of Russia, enacted in 1987, is another example of how violent upheavals simply did not work long-term. Two years into his presidency, Gorbachev announced an economic restructuring that he boasted would upgrade living standards to amazing ones in no time. He suddenly decided to allow the private ownership of businesses as well as the freedom of press according to the glasnost (openness) policy he was jointly pursuing. Unfortunately, the reform turned out to be an out-and-out disaster. As it happened, the expected lack of durable goods extended to sudden shortage of products required to fulfill everyday needs, such as food and clothing. Stagnation of the economy quickly turned into deterioration; clearly, abrupt changes did not last long enough to take whatever good effect it may have had.\\r\\n     Supporters of dramatic change mention the French Revolution as a quick, yet efficient way to effect lasting social change. The motto of \"liberte, egalite, fraternite\" rings true to today, they say. Yet, a closer look disproves such hypotheses quickly and definitely. The French Revolution went through numerous stages headed by countless leaders who each had a slightly different philosophy on how to save their country and her people: the National Assembly, the Legislative Assembly, the National Convention, the Directory, and so on.\\r\\n     In contrast, the gradual settlement of democracy in Great Britain shed neither as much blood nor as much tears of the people while ensuring them their basic rights as human beings. It is no wonder that England maintained a democracy from the time that Magna Carta was signed, whereas France was forced to go through several other costly revolutions even after the French Revolution in order for democracy to truly settle; the former established a democracy far earlier than the latter.

Some worry that private prisons may have poor quality than government prisons because they run for profit. But in my opinion, private prisons can be more accountable and efficient than government prisons.\\r\\n      Firstly, private prisons run for profit, therefore they have to keep their prisons in higher quality in order to get criminals to their prison. By keeping their prisons in better conditions, many criminals will be sent to their prisons. This is what cannot be done in government prisons because they do not get any profit for having more criminals. They don’t run for profit. Even if there is a million-dollar damage, the government will pay for them. Government owned prisons don’t have any rival prisons to cope with, so they may lack in efficiency in the long run.\\r\\n     Secondly, private prisons can disperse criminals packed up in one large government prison. By putting criminals in small numbers, we can anticipate more efficiency. There will be fewer prisoners per guards and teachers for the prisoners. Efficiency cannot be gained by putting criminals large government prisons. But it can be gained by establishing private prisons and custody criminals there. And also, it can be more accountable because it allows us to custody criminals in small numbers, and it is easier to guard small group of people than large horde of people. Which will finally lead to a more accountable prison.\\r\\n     To conclude, private prisons can be more accountable and efficient than government prisons because they have to keep their prisons in higher quality. Also, they have the effect of breaking up the numbers of criminals packed up in large government prisons into small particles of criminals in private prisons. All these aspects mixed up, we can expect more accountable and efficient prisons than before.',\n",

There appeared factories and companies run by capitalists, not government. Also many worldwide companies are building their factories in China. Korean and Japan singers and musicians are now popular and have concerts in China. As a result of opening its door, China became one of the biggest market in the world and growing its economy very fast. China compromised the pressure of communist pressure with capitalism.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Another Asian example, the improvement of Korean-Japanese relationship shows the benefit of compromise. Korean and Japan has been a fatal rival for hundreds of years. Japan invaded Korea many times. Especially, from 1910 ro 1945, Korea had been the colony of Japan. During that period, Japan exploited Korean labors, gold, and foods. After the period, Korea became the rival of Japan on the field of industry of electronic products and the automobiles. But these days, the hostility between Korea and Japan is reducing. Both Korea and Japan are threatened by China whose industry is growing awfully. Korean and Japan companies are allied to overcome the challenge of Chinese companies. Also they are uniting as Asian companies to beat other companies of U.S. and Europe. As a result those united companies became the best selling companies.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Above two examples of Chinese change and Korean-Japanese industrial alliance shows that the compromise is beneficial. Sticking to one side can preserve strong opinion, but to be stubborn can restrict the chance to change and improve. Through yield and compromise we can improve and get better results.\",\n",

       " ('The New York Times has ranked Gutenberg’s printing press as the most important invention of the second millennium. Ever since Gutenberg printed first mass-produced bibles, technology in all fields has advanced tremendously.  The people at opposite poles of the earth can communicate with teach other; an event in one hemisphere has grave consequences on the next.  There are some people who are worried by the seemingly unregulated expansion of technology.  Contrary to their beliefs, there are sufficient regulations on technology in the United States that limit growths of certain areas while still allow for innovation and exploration. There are numerous examples such as stem cell research and television that demonstrates the regulations on the technologies set by both the government and ethics of the creators. Therefore, there are sufficient limitations on technological revolution that does not hinder any innovation or exploration. \\r\\n\\r\\nStem-cell research is a clear example of how the government and voters limit technology through democratic processes. In the world, there are only a handful of nations that allow for human cloning: South Korea, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and the Scandinavian nations. In other industrial nations, the voters and government have decided against any public funding of human cloning thus limiting the pace of experiments and technological innovation in this field. In the United States, both the federal and state governments strictly regulate the progress of stem-cell research. In 2004, the voters in California passed a proposition that earmarks three billion dollars for stem-cell research. Thus in this case, the voters in the state had set boundaries on stem-cell research by limiting public funding, which is a major source of research revenue that allows for further expansion in technology. Therefore, stem-cell research clearly demonstrates how the progress of the technological revolution is limited by democratic processes. \\r\\n\\r\\nDevelopment of nuclear technology is also strictly regulated by both international and national agencies around the world. Nuclear technology has a wide range from development of nuclear fission reactors to proliferation of nuclear arsenal. In this case, the progress of technology is limited by the inventors’ moral beliefs and government regulation. When the Manhattan project was occurring before the Cold War, scientists developing nuclear bombs were aware of the consequences of their works. Thus, they tread in the field of nuclear energy very cautiously. Before the Fat Man, the first nuclear bomb in human history, was detonated in Hiroshima, President Truman who ordered the usage of the bomb also was in moral dilemma. After witnessing the terror created by nuclear arsenal, even during the Cold War, the international community created agencies that would monitor any development in nuclear technology. Therefore, examples in nuclear technology illustrate how devastations and moral dilemma also set limitations on the progress of technological advancement.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is evident that the technological revolution is not occurring too rapidly without any limitations or regulations. The example of stem-cell research shows the democratic process through which regulations on technological progress can be set by the voters. The developments in nuclear technology also demonstrate the effects of moral standards and international monitors on the expansion of technology. Therefore, it is indeed important for our society to create the fragile balance between prevention of any development of harmful technology and fostering a society of innovative intellectuals.',\n",

       " ('A criminal is sent to prison in order to be isolated from the regular society so that he or she won\\'t do any harm. Criminals are also put in prison because when they are released, they can become a \"productive member of the society.\" But the problem with sending criminals to prison is that, unless the criminal is an extremely dangerous one who is isolated even in the prison, the criminal is exposed to more criminals to interact with, and this is not considered a big issue. This is a pathetic environment considering rehabilitation, because most criminals are likely to be influenced from each other and cause more crimes after they are released.\\r\\n     When we tour the insides of a prison, all we see are guards and criminals.  This allows criminals far more time to spend with their fellow criminals, which won\\'t really help them avoid doing criminal acts after they\\'re released, because most of them have dissatisfactions with either the society or what they have done. Each convict will learn from another, and intensify their hatred against the society. Although it is not totally wrong with criminals interacting with other criminals, the threat of criminals having a negative influence on their inmates should be considered thoroughly. This can cause the convicts to be eager to commit more crimes after their release. In my country, Korea, this is evident in most politicians because some notorious ones never give up being corrupt and be sent to jail annually.\\r\\n     It seems that all sorts of criminals are being crammed into this unpleasant building called prison. It is obviously cheaper (for the government) just to lock up criminals inside prisons, but that won\\'t really help the criminals rehabilitate. Prisons, rather than just shoving in a bunch of criminals, should keep psychiatrists and other professionals who can help the criminals with rehabilitation. Humans aren\\'t born inherently corrupt or violent, and if we show care towards people, they do result as being a productive member of the society.\\r\\n     In conclusion, prisons aren\\'t of much benefit to reduce due to the lack of individual care for the prisoners and that criminals are open to interact with other criminals. Perhaps prisons would be more helpful if they were more of a rehabilitation center rather than being a \"storage\" of criminals. With increased care, criminals are bound to show more concern for their actions and how these actions can affect their own lives.',\n",

Figo was the representative star of Barcelona and played for it for 5 years but abandoned it for money. But he wanted money. If he considered love of supporters toward him and his loyalty toward the club,  he should have not moved. But money motivated him more than conscience. \\r\\n\\r\\n  Also my friend was the baseball player of our school team.

       " ('The responsibility of the media is absolutely great in democratic societies. They are the heralds of current events and news; so important was their role, President Theodore Roosevelt dubbed journalists \"muck rakers,\" individuals that elucidate problems of society and fix them by energizing the citizenry. In modern days, however, the integrity and quality of journalism has declined since the first half of the twentieth century. The last presidential elections, there were much implicit political bias in media such as Newsweek magazine, FOX new channel, or even CBS. Moreover, in covering natural disasters like the recent tsunami, the modern media overly exploits single events and alienate the public from the stories. Thus, the media report news more irresponsibly than past. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe most prominent example of irresponsible journalism in recent memories is perhaps Dan Rather\\'s coverage of President Bush\\'s ambiguous military service record during the Vietnam War era. Although it is understandable that the administration’s responses to the media’s questions on the matter obfuscates rather than elucidating the situation, it is not moral for a journalist, who is entrusted by the public to deliver news objectively and truthfully. In their coverage of the Watergate scandal, Bob Woodard and his partner did not fabricate specious evidence to accuse the Nixon administration. On the contrary, Dan Rather used many sketchy evidences, doubtful witnesses, and little background check for validity of sources to report on President Bush’s mysterious past. Moreover, his piece on the controversy illustrated Rather’s bias and opinions on the matter. Thus it is evident that journalists like Dan Rather are irresponsible in their reporting because of the lack of valid evidence and objective voice in their delivery of news and information. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe media are irresponsible in coverage of disasters like the December 26th tsunami in South East Asia. For example, the media exploited stories like the earthquake in Iran that killed tens of thousands people. Because of their excess coverage of the disaster, the public no longer paid any attention to the crisis that still haunts the region in Iran to this day. On interview on the National Public Radio, a humanitarian aid worker in Iran revealed that there were much public support and funding from ordinary citizens in the first six months of the crisis, but the media’s coverage actually alienated the public\\'s attention from the crisis. This now is also a problem with the tsunami relief efforts. Because the media can irresponsibly use stories for their benefit, there is a good chance of a shortage of funds after the deluge of public support during the first months of the crisis. Thus the media can be irresponsible in their coverage of disasters, for their excessive coverage alienate the public and hinder any prolonged relief efforts. \\r\\n\\r\\nTherefore, the media is irresponsible in their reporting of news and information because of their lack of objectivity and exploitation of disasters that hinder long-term humanitarian aids. Because the journalists have the responsibility of reporting stories and elucidating problems of society objectively, actions taken by people like Dan Rather betrays the trust that the public has in them. Also the media coverage of disasters may help with initial public funding, however, often prolonged coverage of the same stories actually reduce the flow of humanitarian aids, for the public loses interest in the matter. Thus, in our society, which is clearly divided over a multitude of issues, it is imperative that journalists act accordingly to their responsibilities and ethics to deliver news impartially and accurately so that the public can make correct decisions.',\n",

People can cheat on games and manipulate  game rules to certain people's advantages. Also, gambling can be used as a method of transferring big money. That said, gambling and crime have a rather complex relationship which is hard to notice.\\r\\n     When gambling is done fair and square in the first place, then obviously the gambling wouldn't be called a crime. However, the truth is that in gambling the existence of cheating is evident. Some game operators even control game rules to certain players' advantages, especially when legal gambling restrictions are hazy. Either way, obtaining money is much easier than gambling fairly, and that is why criminals frequently gamble.\\r\\n     Money laundering is another issue which closely relates gambling to crime. When conveying large sums of money, using banks won't be an ideal method for criminals, because large sums of money are always caught under suspicion and scrutinized thoroughly by the banks. Gambling, on the contrary, offers a much higher degree of privacy. Both the sender and the recipient have direct contact with each other, and the commonness of seeing bets on large sums of money guarantees not to arouse much suspicion.\\r\\n     Gambling is used frequently by criminals.

       " ('One of the most perplexing aspects of human nature is war. Why would a race that prefers peace, justice, and prosperity destroy itself through such destructive process? John Stuart Mill, a British economist of the nineteenth century, in his response to the British involvement in the American civil war, said to Parliament that “war is an ugly thing…but war to protect other human beings against tyrannical injustice…is often the means of their regeneration.”  However, the horrors of war are continuously reminded even today when anyone who owns a television sees images of dying soldiers, derelict houses, and mourning mothers from Iraq. Although as President Bush has said many times in his speeches, including the inaugural speech, the war in Iraq has given the country that had suffered under a tyrannical regime for decades an opportunity to foster democracy in a desert of republican governments. Therefore, as the war in Iraq shows, war has a double-edged quality that can both regenerate human society and bring horrific deaths and destruction. \\r\\n\\t\\r\\n\\tAs the war in Iraq shows, a war can bring new opportunities to empower the voiceless, rescue the oppressed, and punish the tyrants. President Bush is indeed right when he said that the deposal of Saddam Hussein is beneficial for the entire world. Because the United States and its allies demolished Saddam’s tyrannical regime, there is a chance for democracy and a truly republican form of government in the region of the world that is enraptured by a maelstrom of Islamic fundamentalism, poverty, and violence. Because Saddam was deposed by military forces, the Libyan dictator Mu’ammar Gadhafi agreed with the European Union and international agencies to desist all nuclear arms proliferation programs in Libya. Thus, without the examples of Saddam Hussein and the Ba’th party in Iraq, Gadhafi would not have agreed with the international demands so readily. Therefore, it is evident that the Iraq war shows that a war can bring an opportunity for democracy to countries formerly ruled by tyrants and pressure other dictators to heed to international demands. \\r\\n\\t\\r\\n\\tHowever, the opportunity to develop democracy in Iraq also shows the horrors and malice of war. According to the TIME magazine, more than twelve hundred U.S. soldiers were killed in Iraq. Some studies even state that tens of thousands of Iraqi civilian die each month because of uncontrolled insurgencies around the country. The Iraq war also has grave economic consequences. The United States is now suffering the worst deficit in history as well as problems in Social Security and other domestic programs in the country. The price of war in Iraq is now half of what the U.S. government during World War II. Thus, the war that was meant to bring peace and liberty to Iraq in turn has brought the tyranny of fear and chaotic violence that harm both the peace-keeping forces and innocent Iraqi civilians. Moreover, domestically, the citizens of the United States are faced with many economic problems. Thus, it is clear that the Iraq war shows the social and economic consequences of a war. \\r\\n\\t\\r\\n        John Stuart Mill was right in his description of war: a war is indeed a horrific thing that murders the innocents and brings chaos, yet a war for the oppressed people brings opportunity for peace and reforms within society. The war in Iraq clearly demonstrates the double-edge nature of this horrific process. As the Bush administration has states multiple times, the war in Iraq deposed a terrible tyrant and now has given the country a chance to hold elections and empower the previously voiceless people. Yet, the casualties in both military and civilian populations can not be ignored. Also the cost of the war is showing grave economic consequences in the United States. Thus, it is imperative that the world seeks alternatives to war and ONLY wages war when all other possible means to solve conflicts are depleted.',\n",

When entering various web sites, server operators and webmasters constantly receive information about their visitors.

Such security programs often multiply the password by the how many bits the security program was based upon against any attacks from hackers. For example, if the security program was a 32 bit program, that would mean the password of a users acount will be changed to a certain value and multiply that value 32 times, not by 32, which makes a ridiculously large number.

With the information of what inherited disease their children have, parents can act quickly in order to set up future plans for their children.

Genetic testing can also successfully prevent riskfully reproducing more children with genetic disorders.\\r\\n     Parents who are informed of their children\\'s test results are often relieved from the anxiety and fear of  not knowing the existence of genetic diseases or disorders. However, genetic testing is not always psychologically beneficial. Children who undergo genetic testing, unless they are newborn babies, feel like being coerced and be treated by their parents as things rather than individuals, an uncertainty of maternal affection.

       " ('Ever since the Babylonian king, Hammurabi immortalized his codes of law on a victory stele, the treatment of criminals has been a controversial issue. Laws such as the codes presented by Hammurabi harshly punish criminals for their ill-willed actions against society. However, one has to wonder the efficacy of such punishment system, that include incarceration in prisons. In the mid-nineteenth century, women like Dorothea Dix led movements to improve the treatment and condition of prisoners in the United States. Their work was so successful that the French aristocrat Alexis de Tocqueville traveled to America to observe and learn from the reformed prison system. Despite the reforms set by these women and other activists, crime still exists throughout the country. In literature, kind, benevolent characters like Pip from “Great Expectations” treat lowly criminals like Magwitch and can alter their character to be more humane. One of the legacies of the Clinton administration was the reduction of organized crime in major cities of America through economical developments. Therefore, compassion and economic assistance are more effective means of reducing crime than imprisonment. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn Charles Dickens’ “Great Expectations,” the character Pip clearly shows the effects of compassion in rehabilitating criminals and reduction of crime. The character, who is threatened by a fugitive criminal named Magwitch for food, instead embraces the criminal and offers the best bread and cherry from his humble family, knowing that his tyrannical sister would punish him for such actions. This act of compassion touches Magwitch’s cold heart and eventually becomes Pip’s incognito benefactor by sponsoring Pip’s transformation from a simple apprentice to a blacksmith to a respectable gentleman of the Victorian society. Thus the kind act of a child altered the heart of a cold-blooded criminal who in turn contributed to society by funding the child’s education. If society treats criminals and all members of society with much compassion and care for their well-being, then crime will surely be reduced, for such acts of benevolence can eliminate the criminals’ need to commit such misdeeds in the first place. Therefore, acts of compassion are clearly a better alternative to imprisonment. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe presidency of Bill Clinton, which was filled with many great legacies, also shone because of a steady decrease in crime rates across the nation. In cities like New York City, before Clinton was elected president, crimes were rampant and there were no solutions to reduce such actions. However, during the Clinton administration, the crime rates began to drop because of economic boom of the 1990’s. In New York City, the crime rate before Clinton had been 15,000 crimes per 100,000 citizens. By the end of Clinton’s second term, the crime rate was reduced to less than 6,000 crimes per 100,000 citizens. Although it is true that then-mayor of New York City, Rudy Giuliani initiated many aggressive policies against crime, he also had to face dozens of lawsuits for violations of the first amendment. Nevertheless, crime rates in cities like New York decreased because the economic boom allowed for real estate developments in downtown areas and increased government assistance for the lower income families. Thus, it is clear that the economic boom was the major factor behind the reduction of crimes during the Clinton era. \\r\\n\\r\\nIt is evident that compassion and economic developments are better means of reducing crime than imprisonment. Pip’s benevolence changed Magwitch who became a benefactor and supported Pip with education and development as an adult. Also, the economic boom of 1990’s not only bring prosperity, but also a great reduction in crime rates. Financial development of crime-infested areas and increase in governmental assistance for the lower income population were successful in decreasing crime rates across the nation. Therefore, it is crucial that, despite the great deficit in government budgets, there is a continuous efforts to reduce crime not by imprisonment, but through truly reformative actions like education and financial assistance.',\n",

There can be a lot of reasons why such changes occur, but it can be summarized into 2 large categories.\\r\\n     Firstly, people always pursuit for convenience. They do not wish to use or live with inconvenient machine or system. Therefore, they always try to make the inconvenient things into more convenient things.

But as the machine making clothes appeared, tailor-made clothes were not used anymore because machine-made clothes were more convenient and they were higher in quality.\\r\\n     Secondly, people always want to be free.

Many Korean-Chinese people fight for their freedom in Korea.\\r\\n     To conclude, people always tend to change because people want to be convenient, and they want to be free.

       " ('Courage has always been a human virtue that is celebrated by all members of society. Heroes of epic poems exhibit courage through their gallant feats and superhuman accomplishments. However, courage is not always demonstrated through such acts of valor. In reality, heroes are found performing deeds that other members of society would not necessarily desire doing. For example, the bravest of all heroes are those that tell truth to power and fight for the powerless and against injustice. In literature other than epic poems, true heroes are the characters that are able to overcome personal desires in order to do the right thing. And the recent election held in Iraq is indeed an impressive demonstration of tremendous amount of courage in the face of death threats and lurking terrorist movements. Therefore, courage does come in many different forms through many different heroes who all deserve the accolade of posterity. \\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the Nazi regime, Oskar Schindler was indeed valorous when he used a ruse in order to save thousands of Jews from extermination in horrendous death camps like Auswitz. In the Nazi Germany, it was inconceivable to defy party policies and still be a respected or even surviving member of society. In order to rescue the Jewish prisoners doomed to die in horrible gas chambers, Schindler, an armaments factory owner, used his own business as a ruse to save Jews while pretending to harshly treat them in decrepit work conditions. Instead, Schindler tried to foster the Jewish culture by allowing his Jewish laborers to celebrate the Sabbath in his own factory, which indeed was an audacious act in midst of a totalitarian society. Because of his hard work, Schindler was able to rescue more than four thousands Jews from extermination. Therefore, Oskar Schindler showed his courage through his defying of the Nazi party in order to save thousands of innocent people from their seemingly inevitable demise. \\r\\n\\r\\nSimilar to Schindler’s work, the character Jean Valjean in “Les Miserables” exhibits courage through his transformation from a vile criminal to an affluent member of French society who assists the poor, the voiceless, and the sick. The inception of Victor Hugo’s novel shows how Jean Valjean’s life is saturated with adversity and unhappiness. Thus, Valjean steals a loaf of bread for which he must be imprisoned for years in a horrible prison. When he is released, he again steals silver candle sticks from a quaint church whose bishop saves Valjean from Javert, a dutiful police officer, by covering for Jean Valjean. With the money, Valjean, under the incognito name Madeliene, becomes a successful factory owner. When his path again crosses with Javert about Fontaine and Cosette, her illegitimate daughter, Valjean saves Cosette from her abusive foster parents and raises her to be a well-educated woman. Even at the end, when the revolutionaries try to execute Javert, Valjean intervenes to save the life of his nemesis and the life of the revolutionary leader. Thus, Valjean clearly shows his courage by overcoming his past life and ameliorating the lives of others by becoming the mediator and benefactor to all those who need his help. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe recent election held in Iraq also exhibits the courageous voters that defied the death threats of unseen terrorists. For months, the violence in Iraq had worried the entire world for the stability in the country and raised many doubts for the feasibility of a general election in January. During January 2005, there was a crescendo of terrorist attacks, which were supposed to frighten the voting citizenry from participating in the democratic process. On January 30th, 2005, the Iraqi population triumphed over the insurgencies, for a large number of people across the country voted for their candidates. Although some areas of the Sunni triangle saw a very small participation, the election mirrored that of a rich, democratic nation. If such election were held in countries that already have stable systems of democracy under such unfavorable situation, the election results might be different. However, the Iraqi people showed their courage on the election day by participating in large numbers and developing a foundation for a democracy not only in Iraq but perhaps across the Middle East region. Thus, the Iraqi election showed courage as a fight against tyranny for liberty and freedom. \\r\\n\\r\\nIt is indeed evident that courage does come in many different forms. Heroes like Oskar Schindler defied a totalitarian regime in order to rescue thousands of people from horrible deaths even though they were aware of dire consequences of their actions. Literary heroes like Jean Valjean shows courage through his acts of compassion and reconciliation with his dark past, nemesis, and social flaws. The example of the Iraqi election clearly demonstrated the courage and valor of the voters who participated regardless of bombing threats and increased insurgent movements around the country. Therefore, members of society must learn from the examples of these heroic deeds and strive to act conscientiously in order to correct the problems in society that affect millions of people around the world.',\n",

       " ('Guns, when in the hands of a human, is a dangerous tool. In the state of present guns becoming superior to older weapons and more convenient in use, along with less production of safety devices to moderate gun use,  gun manufacturers can\\'t be considered as paying effort towards manufacturing safer weapons.\\r\\n     First, gun manufacturers don\\'t manufacture enough products that can reduce the use of guns. Consider the safety locks, which most guns have. The only obstruction to firing guns are the safety locks. However, safety locks are just too simple to operate, and they only have two options -- lock the gun so it can\\'t be fired, or unlock the gun so it can be fired. Any child fiddling with a real gun might unlock the safety lock if he or she has enough strength. Gun manufacturers should implement a more complex method of operating the safety locks of their guns, like \"Trigger Locks\", which require password-like combinations to unlock guns so that only authorized users can use the weapon. However, the critical truth of such devices is that they purposefully aren\\'t produced as much as weapons (because they moderate weapon use, which then leads to reduced sales of the guns themselves) and are harder to get, which shows that gun manufacturers clearly don\\'t do their best on making safe weapons.\\r\\n     Second, gun manufacturers spend too much effort on improving their weapons\\' dangerousness, which overwhelmingly outweighs their efforts on making weapons safer. Today\\'s guns have greater accuracy, higher rate of fire, larger magazine capacity, greater durability, and, most important, are easier to use than most weapons of the past. Simply put, newer guns will be able to shoot more effiecient shots. An automatic handgun of today can shoot  approximately 1~10 more bullets at the same whilst the old-design revolvers can shoot only six. Also, automatics reload by themselves after each shot, while revolvers and other old weaponry are reloaded manually by hand. Does this make guns safer? We can certainly say that weapons have become more reliable. However, the more reliable weapons get, the easier it is to harm others using these weapons, thus making them more deleterious.\\r\\n     In short, gun manufacturers don\\'t struggle hard to manufacture safer weapons. The low availability of security tools for guns, coupled with the ever-increasing effectiveness of weapons today make guns more dangerous than ever.',\n",

Many people say that computer is of no good to young people, and sometimes can be harmful. But I think computer was more valuable than anything else because it helped me greatly in many ways.\\r\\n     Firstly, computer enabled me to do my schoolwork easily. Especially, the internet helped me a lot. For example, when I needed to do some research on Leonardo Da Vinci, all I had to do was to type ‘Leonardo Da Vinci’ in my internet Encyclopedia. It gave me tons of information about him, so it was much easier to do schoolwork. Computer was useful not only when I did my homework, but also it was also useful when I needed to study myself. A lot of computer programs enabled me to study alone. For example, the ‘Rosetta Stone’ helped me gain my English skills when I was a young kid.\\r\\n     Secondly, computer enabled me to get access to many communities. I think that one of the most important part of the internet is its usage as communication mean. I can talk with my friend who is in America over the MSN messenger, and even see his face with a camera. Also, I was able to get access to many internet communities. Communities such as GBAMANIA.com and Ragnagate.net are one of the most important internet communities. I learned many things from communicating with people whom I don’t know, thus learning how to deal with other people in the internet.\\r\\n     Thirdly, computer made it easy for me to listening to my favorite music. I can buy any music I want to in iTUNES, and download it to my iPOD. It is so convenient that I can just click once or twice, and the music is in my iPOD. Since music takes a great part in my life, computer, enabling me to get access to music more easily, was some kind of a revolution.\\r\\n     To conclude, computer did the most help to my life. It helped me a lot when I did my homework, made me to gain access to many communities, and it enabled me to gain access to music.',\n",

       " (\"I agree with the statement that our present system of education gives us too much pressure to demonstrate acquisition of knowledge. We have to realize our lack of knowledge, yet there is no time or chance to do so. All we have to do is to get good scores on tests. The examples of the olympiad I took two years ago and the Korean SAT show that the current education system does not allow us the chance to admit shortcomings and improve them.\\r\\n\\r\\n I was one of the students who competed in the Korean Chemistry Olympiad two years ago. To get a good result, we had to study from about three or four books which are one year textbooks in colleges in from one to two years. We were only high school freshmen. So it was almost impossible to master all books. Surely, there were very smart guys who mastered almost all texts, but I goe better results than them. I got the second place because I learned 'how' to solve problems. THe test consisted in solving given problems in limited time, and the styles of problems were also limited. So I could cover my lack of knowledge with test-taking skills. Also my friends did so and got good results. I knew my lack of knowledge, But there was no times to make it up. And the fastest way was practicing test skills to get a higher score. The skills themselves did not help my knowledge improve, but my teachers tole me that the result, not my knowledge, was important. Nobody cared about knowledge when I got the second prize.\\r\\n\\r\\n Another example, Korean SAT also shows that the education system does not make us improve our weak points. The test is all multiple-choice. It means we can 'choose' the answer, not solve it. Choosing the good answer is also a skell. Though many students study hard to find their weak points and amend them, some students take lectures and solve awfully many questions. Korean SAT has five hundred full points. A student got 490 is often brighter than another student who got 500. But getting 500 seems better than getting 490. The test gives us only the score and it doesn't tell about oure knowledge, but how many we got it all right. And the test is most important to go to college.\\r\\n\\r\\n  The above two examples show that our education system doesn't make us admit our lack of knowledge. The system emphasize test scoring. And getting good  scores in those thests doesn't ogten make us improve our knowledge and be perfect. There must be the alternative system that makes us find our weak points and study for the sake of knowledge.\",\n",

For normal human beings, school is the place where you learn most of the abstract things that will help you become successful. As I have attended both an American shcool and a Korean School, I found some benefits that an American School had compared to other schools in the world. \\r\\nThe most obvious fact that people can see from American schools is the teachers effort towards the students. This could be requried or even natural, but I think the main reason is that there are a small number of students. It is imperative for the teachers to know about their students, in able to teach them successfully.  For an example, teenage years is a time period where people become senstive and faces puberty. The small number of students enables the teacher to meet with the students individually not only to help them in academically but also to help students solve the problems that they have to face in real life. By knowing each student's personality, a teacher can be more specific in his or her teaching.\\r\\nAs America is one of the strongest country in this world, others tend to follow them. The basic step of their successfulness was their curriculum. Compared to Asian countries where the school forces the students to attend this and this subject, a standerized American curriculum provides a variety of courses for students to take in their high school years. For an example, when I took a placement test in my freshmen year, I was qualified to take Algebra II which was mainly for sophmores. I knew that if I were in Korea I would have to be stuck with the freshman math which I already have mastered. \\r\\nTherefore, these are my real life experiences that I have noticed in my school life. As I believe that one's teenage years is its first golden age, I hope that all of the students in this world, would have an opportunity to attend a school like the ones in America!\",\n",

Some people say that people are smart enough not to act like animal, saying that the strong tend to protect the social weak people. But in my Opinion, the exactly same thing that happened in animal’s world is happening in our society.\\r\\n     When we look into Korean history, the former president of Korea, Park Jung Hee did whatever he wished. He called out for economic growth of Korea. But only for that reason, many Korean people’s liberty was ignored completely.

In Korea, students spend most of their times studying. They don’t have enough time to do extra-curricular activities. On the other hand, American schools encourage their students to do their extracurricular activities. Except in their difference in extracurricular activities, there are many differences between Korean schools and American schools.\\r\\nFirstly, American school students tend to enjoy life more than Korean students do. They play sports, have some part-time jobs so that they can have some social experience. But in Korea, students who play sports or have some part-time jobs are regarded as students who don’t want to study. I think that it is important for students to have some experience in society. Only studying at home and school can make Jack a dull student. So, I think that encouraging students to do extracurricular activities is a good aspect of American schools.\\r\\nSecondly, In American schools, students tend to have a debate freely or ask teachers when there is anything that they don’t know. In Korean schools, neither debating nor asking teachers about their inquiries are things that are difficult to do. Although students can learn many things through debate, Korean teachers find it difficult to debate with students. And also, Korean teachers think that students who ask them their inquiries are trying to make fun of them by asking the questions they don’t know.

But it is quite strange even trying to classify entertainers from others. Entertainers are not different species or mankind, but just a kind of job. Nevertheless people expect something different from entertainers than the ordinary people who they see usually around them. People want entertainers to be something special. So even though they are not responsible to be role model, entertainers have to act as role model to fulfill people\\'s expectation. As for this, from the beginning, being role model is not the matter of responsibility of entertainers, but it is their job to be the role model for common people.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tEntertainers cannot live immoderate life, because even small or ordinary things such as divorce, fighting, marriage, and even car accident can be scandalous gossip. So entertainers have to care about their private life much more than other people because it can easily hurt their career. Spontaneously they have to act like what people want them to be. When I talked with classmates, they usually said \"My darling is extremely pure, so he must be a cherry boy still.\" To fulfill the fantasy of those insane girls, many entertainers deadly struggle in screen even now. Some might argue that then how about those who caught in the jail so often because of fighting or drug. But in the world, there are some people who have a great yearning for dirty guy fantasy. Anyhow, they are also the role models of minority.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tIronically, even though people treat entertainers someone different, they are most familiar existence in same time. The Korean students who spend their whole time at school and educational institute cannot meet face to face with their family more than 30 minutes a day. But the information about entertainers is easily received from friendly media such as Internet or television. It is hard to admire someone far away and information is unknown. There is no existence that students know as much stuff as entertainer\\'s. Syllogistically, it is necessary that they see their ideal from entertainers. I talked like it is only limited to students, but it is because the people who are aged more than twenty do not have their role model as common as teenagers.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tMore over, people do not see entertainers directly. They are exaggerated and idealized. When a person admires someone, naturally little things that she or he does not like are filtered therefore their fantasy is not ruined. It is more excessive when the target is the entertainer. (I do not know why though.) People do not care those entertainers\\' essential quality is similar to their ideal or not. Inevitably that so-called role model is something flamboyant but shallow. That is why people do not treat entertainer as their role model anymore as they become older and wiser.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tI may sound harsh and cynical, but that is the truth. Entertainers are role models for only teenagers most of time, and people do not admire them anymore as they graduate the adolescences. But fortunately, babies are born continuously, and they will become teenager once in their life.

In fact those progresses our forerunners made develop many aspects of our life, such as convenient transport, medical technology, and e-network system. However, I disagree that progress always does not give us positive aspects, because some times, progress we made returns to us harmfully. Let’s examine the progress is always positive.\\r\\nFirst, many countries use too much fuel-energy to perform their progress more effectively, whether to use much fuel energy makes our land pollute or not. We use much fuel energy every day and night. We are now very convenient, but we depend on fuel energy too much. Even a small clock can not run without small batteries, and huge factory can not run without fuel energy. To use much energy can not be great misery to us, if we do not consider about pollution which fuel energy make when they are used. \\r\\nAir pollution made by almost when people use their vehicles can cause green leaves to turn pale, and make us not to breathe easily; because of seasickness, we can not drink our water without purifying, and many endangered pieces of bird, fish, and sea animals are threatened. Hence, soil pollution prevent from growing plants. This is why I disagree progress is always positive. \\r\\nSecond, We loss our own private place, because the internet which connects us cyber world conquers all around world. For example, I spend many times to use and play with internet; sometimes I check out some goods I ordered, and make new e-mail accounts. Every single website wants me some private identifications. I do not want to answer them, but for the access, I have to do, and ask myself ‘is it safe to upload my private?’. However, no one knows answer, because no one can protect from some one’s illegal cracking. This is another example why progress does not always gain positive results.\\r\\nThird, ironically, medical technology boosts our progress, but that progress is not always positive. For instance, in Korea, many marred people want to bear boy than girl, because of social statue which prefer to male, so when mom has a baby, the married couple go to hospital, and check the baby’s sex. If the baby is boy, they celebrate themselves, but the baby is girl, they disappoint about that seriously, and sometimes have a abortion whether they acknowledge the importance of baby or not. To speak honestly, I sometimes wonder what are their moral points of view to act cruelly. This is the last example why progress is not always positive. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn conclusion, there are many negative aspects progress poses. There is no doubt that progress gains positive result, however progress make world pollute, loss our own place, and conduct with amoral. For these reasons and others, I disagree that progress is always positive.',\n",

Then, we finally can find true meaning of them.\\r\\n \\r\\n Conscience has the meaning of ‘the thing all people know’. That means it can be more powerful motive than human desires to gain public sympathy everywhere.

As insisting antiviolence and dreaming independence of India, he played a major role contributing to reveal British wrong  behaviors and to acquire the autonomy of India from them.

Without desiring his individual desires, he pursued right thing for giving independence to India and maintaining piece in the world. Finally, despite Britain oppression, India gained independence and Gandhi’s behavior could acquire public response everywhere.\\r\\n \\r\\n Conscience can make human behaviors more persistent and deeper than human desires do. The behavior in our inner voice is not easily affected by other circumstance’s change until it is carried out. That means human conscience which is different from our desires is defined as the measure to classify between right and wrong.\\r\\n \\r\\n For example, many politician candidates used to do lots of goodness for their fame during their election period, such as serving to the handicapped or supporting great deal of money to education institution. However, if election period ended, many of them are easy to quit doing goodness which they are progressing because their main motive of doing it is their fame and power so their behaviors are superficial and not persist. However someone who regards helping the poor and the handicapped as right things in his or her conscience can do the behaviors deeply and consistently. As seen in the situation above, we can realize that the behaviors from conscience can have true meanings.\\r\\n\\r\\n Human behaviors are mistakenly seemed to be driven by individual selfish desires. However, I insist that conscience is more powerful resource than them.\\r\\nAlthough it can not give material and social benefits to the person who does the behaviors in his or her conscience, the behaviors win public sympathy and can be consistant and sincere.',\n",

       " (\"Before determining intellectual property has the right to be protected by law or not, first we have to determine clearly what intellectual property is. Intellectual property is the one's private possession based on the intelligence, as for it covers every knowledge which need the brain, such as mathematics, literature, even art. It is too ambiguous, so if someone insisted he owns it he does, and if someone admits he does not own it he does not. Therefore the owners need the evidence to prove their possessions. Publishing their idea is one of the most reliable methods. In other way, they can choose the monograph, the formula, or the score. The owners ought to have something that confirms they understand the information completely and add their peculiar ideas to that to make the intellectual property their own possession.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tIf the law can protect intellectual property only with the evidence, then what is the difference between the mere Copyright Act? Copyright Act had made to authorize and protect one's possession and of course the intellectual property is included in the private possession. So if the law to protect the intellectual property will be enacted it will belongs to the category of Copyright Act. However unlike material properties, intellectual property itself does not have the shape even though there are the books or the scores. That is the difference between the intellectual property and others.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tBut to those who are discontent that the material properties will be handed to somebody else in the future and the owner's name will be forgotten, intellectual property is very attractive. Even though the owner died, his own intellectual properties have left, and people remember his name. If his intellectual property was innovative one, his name can be recorded in history. Videlicet, the individual cannot persist the possession completely, but the fact that he had it will be guaranteed after his death. (But in the modern constitutional law, one's copyright has extinguished 100 years after the creator's death.)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tSome might argue that then the intellectual properties that are not recorded do not have the right to be protected at all. Answer is no they do not. It may sounds mortified to some, but it cannot be helped. Even though someone wrote a book greater than Dostoevsky or found more innovative theory than Einstein's ones in his head, it only happens in his head. No matter how he insists he is great genius, the fact he is the braggart has not changed unless he demonstrates it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tNew people are born continuously and things are limited. So it is almost impossible to find completely new theory. New theories come from old theory. Like this, intellectual properties are not just standing by itself, but building on each other. Beautiful phrases are most beautiful when they are on the tongues of people. The math formulas show their ability when people solve the question with them.

And it will cause the next crimes and next victims. It is endless vicious circle. But if the law takes the role of punishment, there is no one to blame. Even though the bereaved family of criminal feels resentment at the nation, it is not a scale that the individual can revenge. So it is the cleanest way to conclude every grudges. Even though the victims hate the assailants so much they cannot just revenge on them because of their morality or they do not have enough bravery. So the laws have the responsibility to punish the criminals instead of victims and ease their grief.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tWhen I watch the movie or the drama, sometimes they tell some criminals have proper reason to commit such a huge crime and compel the sympathy on them. It is also easy to see the crimes and revenges are idealized. However even though it has the great excellent reason, the crime is still crime and criminals are supposed to be punished. Do not forget there are people who are injured with those excellent reason and death penalty have to exist to relieve those people.',\n",

By restraining convicted criminals in prison, rather than releasing them back onto the streets, it is a highly effective way of cutting down on the number of murders, rapes, robberies, assaults and thefts. Due to these reasons I believe that prisons do reduce the number of crimes. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe number of crimes will increase and the society will face confusion, if there are no prisons. Without prisons how would the criminals be put into justice? And where would the criminals go after committing crimes? If there is no way of punishing these criminals, our society will face a tremendous confusion. There is a high chance of citizens to commit crimes such as robberies and stealing since there is no way of punishing them. Prisons scare people; prisons prevent people from stealing and robbing. I once read an article in the New York Times, written by Professor John J, Dilulio Jr, the professor stated that prisons do reduce crimes. From his studies, he indicated that keeping one prisoner incarcerated reduces the number of crimes committed anywhere from twelve to twenty one each year. Also a justice department study estimated that tripling the prison populating from 1975 to 1989 have reduced the crime by ten to fifteen percent below what it would otherwise have been. The studies of Professor John J, Dilulio Jr, shows, it costs society at least twice as much to let a prisoner loose than to lock them up, comparing with the human and financial toll of revolving door justice, prisons are a real bargain.\\r\\n\\r\\nPrisons are only way to prevent and reduce crimes from happening. By locking criminal up in jail, the number of crimes will definitely decrease. Due to these facts and reasons I believe that prisons do reduce crimes.',\n",

Marijuana is also known as \"pot,\" \"herb,\" \"weed,\" \"boom,\" and it is usually smoked as a cigarette. In some countries, marijuana is used as a medicine. Marijuana can cure some illness and be used as a pain relief for cancer patients. However using too much marijuana can be addictive and most of all in some countries like U.S, marijuana is treated as an illegal drug. Thinking of these reasons, I don’t think marijuana is a safe and effective medicine. Instead it is a treacherous drug that should be banned.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn countries like China and Vietnam, marijuana is used as a medicine. The Chinese people used marijuana to treat malaria, relieve asthma, calm the nerves, regulate the function of the heart, and to treats paralysis. In Vietnam, marijuana is used to alleviate loss of memory, eliminate blood loss, and to treat gynecological problems. As you can see, there are many different uses for marijuana as medicine but most of all marijuana is used as a pain relief for cancer patients. When my grandfather was suffering from cancer, his doctor subscribed marijuana to him as a pain relief. To cancer patients marijuana seems to be most effective three hours after dosage, and last for five hours.  Even though marijuana can be effective as a medicine it is still an illegal drug that can harm ones body. \\r\\n\\r\\nMarijuana can be addictive and can harm the patient’s body. I once read in a book and the book stated that “after inhaling marijuana, the inhaler will feel ‘high’ like above the sky and will feel that they are in utopia.” Due to this unique feeling the inhaler will keep using marijuana and in the end the inhaler will not be able to survive the ‘real world’ without marijuana. Drugs, such as marijuana can also increase the rate of crimes, since the inhaler will do crimes to get the money to buy marijuana. When the patients get addicted to marijuana their life will be controlled by drugs (can’t survive a day with out it), which will eventually destroy their life. Not only can marijuana be addictive but it can also damage the patient’s body.  Marijuana can be harmful in a number of ways, through both immediate effects and damage health over time. By using marijuana, the patients can experience physical changes such as low or high heart rate, dizziness, short-term memory which will destroy their body. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEven though marijuana is used as a medicine to cure patients I think there is a high possibility for the patients to get addicted and damage their body.  I think marijuana should be treated as an illegal drug that must be banned rather than to use it as a medicine. Patients who used marijuana find themselves experiencing low or high heart rate changes, dizziness, short-term memory and addicted. Marijuana can damage one’s body physically and mentally but it also can be addictive and destroy one’s life.',\n",

Those campaigns and documentary films on mass media make people to decide they will not eat the meat anymore.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tOne more primary factor of increasing the amount of vegetarian is the development of the medical science.

Human naturally requires the protein and if a person does not incept the protein, the worst consequence is death.

Especially, Nevada turned out to have the highest rate of firearm-fatality deaths per 100,000 people. Guns aren’t toys that can be played with; they are serious weapons that can kill and injure people. Due to these reasons I think there should be an age limit for owning a gun. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn order to own a gun, the person must be responsible and be able to control themselves. The owner must be responsible, they should keep their guns in a safe place where children or other people can’t see or get in touch with. I don’t remember the specific name of the movie, but in some movies there are always some irresponsible adult who doesn’t take care of their guns, and unfortunately, their children get hold of the gun and someone always gets hurt. Also the owner should be mature enough to control themselves. Sometime when things turn out to be bad, the owners think about using their guns to kill someone, to commit a crime or to threaten someone. Some young teenagers, who are lack of patience and thoughts, aren’t able to control themselves and seldom have they turn out to do these kinds of actions without thinking about the consequences. About a month ago there was a shocking report from the news, that a junior teenager in Canada killed 3 teachers and his classmates by using a gun and committed suicide. I think this kind of accident happens because some people with guns are lack of thinking the dangerousness of the weapon that they have. \\r\\n\\r\\nGuns aren’t toys that people can play around with. It is capable of exterminating and wounding people. There are many qualities to be gun owners however I think responsibility and able to control them are the most important factors.

I have tried to commit suicide before, when I was in 3rd grade. However, I have found out that the most important thing that helped me was a normal project I worked on in high school. It was my biology experiment. \\r\\n     I began working on this experiment since my freshmen year. I have a male partner, who works with me, too. We have finished one research paper so far. The first thing this experiment taught me was responsibility. One of my jobs was to set up the experiment before class started, and raising the water temperature by ten degrees every second period everyday. It was hard for me at first. Howefer, if I did not do my responsibility, we could not make data for our experiment. By doing my task everyday, I learned how importatnt my responsibility was and learned how to follow it. \\r\\n     Another factor that helped me in life was cooperation. I hardly knew my partner before I started the experiment. However, we got to know each other and talked a lot during the hard times we had when we had to stay school until three in the morning. We slowly learned how to divide the work between us so that it would be fair and equal. We learned how to help each other when one wasn't there. I had fun as we got ready for the presentation we had to make as we watched and monitored each other before the big day. \\r\\n     As time went by, we got ready for a research paper contest that was held by Samsung. It was a competitive one, but we wanted to try this competition since we started the experiment. We worked hard. For many days, we stayed up late in school revising our paper over and over again. Sleepless nights followed, and finally we submitted our paper. Few weeks later, it showed that we had even failed the preliminaries. Tears filled my eyes, but as I looked back, I saw that I had been arrogant all along. I was too proud that a high schooler had wrote a research paper already. I was too proud that I could show my friends that I was doing something they were not doing. I was too arrogant. The failure in the competition made me realize my arrogance, and now, I am confident that I will watch out for this factor in the future in any of my projects. \\r\\n     The biological experiment taught me many things besides knowledge of biology. It taught me responsibility and cooperation. But most of all, it taught me not to be arrogant at all times.

The trip to Bin tan happened during my school Christmas holiday. Our family chose Bin tan because it was summer all year long, and we could enjoy playing golf there. Our aim was to play golf as much as we could. And the most humorous experience happened while we were playing golf. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe golf course at Bin tan is known for its beautiful scenery and its harmony with the nature. The courses are in the middle of the forest, where there are lots of tropical trees, plants, fresh air and sometimes wild life animals can be seen. By wild life animals I don’t mean dangerous animals, I meant monkeys and some weird harmless Bin tan animals. Our family played golf for three consecutive days, and the humorous experience happened on the last day at Hole 13 which was Par 3 hole. My dad took a shot first and his ball landed on the edge of the green. Next my mom’s ball got stock in the bunker while my ball landed the closest to the hole putt. I was filled with joy thinking that I could easily get a birdie in this hole. We rode out bogie to near the green, while my mom was driving the bogie, a small baby monkey who came down to the green and took my ball and ran away. I couldn’t believe what happened in front of my eyes, I couldn’t stop myself from laughing. I jumped out of the bogie and started to chase the monkey who took my ball. While I was chasing it, the monkey disappeared into the forest. My dad told me to forget about it and we resumed our game. After finishing hole 13, we headed to our bogie, suddenly a group of monkeys came out of the forest walking like gangsters they were heading to our bogie. My mom and I was freaked out and we started to run away in order to get in to the safe distance. The monkeys were sniffing our bags to find food. They picked the right bag which was filled with drinks and foods and they took everything that was inside our bag. It was too funny that I thought we were being taped by a television show. My parents and I were laughing; we couldn’t believe what had happen to us. \\r\\n\\r\\nIt was such a humorous experience that our family still talks about the incident that happened to us.

What were our obligations in life and why we existed as a society were some of the many questions I had about mankind. However, the greatest inquiry I had of all these curiosities was why our pleasures in life were taken away by an inevitable destiny of mankind called death. When we ceased to live, we would stop smelling the fragrance of Nature’s work. We would stop feeling that urge to kiss someone we loved. We would stop feeling any emotions of happiness or sadness. Why were we destined to die?\\r\\n     A month ago, I found out that my grandfather, that is, my mother’s father, had lung cancer. Maybe we can find a way to treat it, I said to my parents. No, it’s too late, they replied. I was told that the virus had spread from his gallbladder into his lungs and had already developed into a big tumor. In addition to this, my grandmother also appeared to have severe signs of the Alzheimer’s disease. She asked me the same question five times in a short time of twenty minutes; she forgot when I was going back to school even though I told her five minutes ago. \\r\\n     The two homecoming days I had were a disaster. I went to visit my grandparents’ house. These were the people who cared for me until I went to the States with my parents. These were the people who I called family. I had to stop myself from crying as I watched my grandfather pick up a glass of water with two trembling hands instead of the one firm hand he had used. I had to watch his face change as black spots appeared on his forehead as side effects of the medicine he was taking for his cancer treatment. I also noticed how his hair had fallen out a lot. My grandmother also had a hard time, and it was definite that they could not nurse each other since the both of them were sick. \\r\\n     My mom sighed all the time, and cried when she thought of her sick parents. Her face had created an angle between her cheeks and chin, where all the plumpness she had were all gone. Her face was in a shade of gloom. But this wasn’t all that happened. The depressing atmosphere of my whole family depressed me intensely, too. I did not study for a month; I did not sleep much; I did not eat much. I lost five kilograms (which was a good thing, I have to say) and my face had become a gloomy figure in the whole month of November. \\r\\n     But, if I was this much depressed and did nothing with my precious time, would my grandparents be happy with me? I doubt it. It would be probably the last thing they would want to see. After contemplating a lot, I saw life as a novel of mankind, and God or Mother Nature or whatever superior being that created all living things as the author of this novel. In this novel, the author had used death to make life more valuable. It was contrast. Like the line in the movie The Hours, someone had to die. Someone had to die in order for the rest of us to value life more, to be more thankful for whatever we had. \\r\\n     Yes, I hope this to be true so that I may take the sicknesses of my grandparents as a signal from God to quickly convert them to my religion and ‘save’ them. I took it as a signal for me to use my time efficiently from now on, not like this November, when I did absolutely nothing. I started to be thankful for this healthy environment with fresh air and a lot of trees so that I would not end up being weak like my grandfather, who also had diabetes, come to think of it now. And I took it as an incentive to work harder and study harder simply because it would make my grandparents have happier ends than other people in their part of the novel.\\r\\n     We will never know what will happen to us tomorrow or the next day, or the day after. It may be a continuous strip of plain days, or maybe something tragic will happen. But one thing is for sure, and that is to always value our life and to be thankful for all we have, since we never know when we will lose this chance and disappear from this lovely world.',\n",

As in the case of South and North Koreas, the development of North Kora with communist ideology was actually carried on more swiftly than the ones of South Korea. This phenomenon happens since democracy used at the beginning for a developing country can be detrimental. The democracy in developing countries can be detrimental because in democracy, uneducated majority can overrun the ideas of intelligent minority causing the country to go in a chaos. While this confusion is going on in developing countries, other devloping countries using different ideology gets ahead similar to the case of two Koreas.\\r\\n     For developing countries use of democracy could slow down their development, however as the country becomes more developed the need for democracy is absolutely essential. The need for democracy in the later stages of a country is seen around the world where all the leading countries use democratic ideology to run their country. Democracy becomes important at later stages of a country because democracy is the only method for a country in keeping the development at the same level. This level can only be kept by democracy since its principles include factors that helps societies to solve conflicts.

       " (\"People tend to think that leaders are perfect people. Leaders do not make mistakes; leaders are excellent intellectuals; and leaders are people with good character. I believe that this statement is false. In history, there are many leaders who were not of good character. One of these many leaders is Adolf Hitler of Germany. \\r\\n     Even though Hitler has lead many massacres of the Jews, he cannot be withdrawn from the class of leaders. He had eloquent speech, charisma, and fine determination that made the mass follow him through the road of anti-Semitism genocide. From his appearance, many people deducted that he was a fine and healthy German. Well, he wasn't on the inside. \\r\\n    Alois Hitler, his father was born without a father. That is, he didn't know exactly who his real father was. All he knew was that he was taken to his uncle to be brought up there as some kind of worker. However, as he finds out that there is a strong possibility of him having a Jewish father, Alois becomes fearful and anxious in the anti-Semitism atmosphere that has been around him in his Austrian town. \\r\\n     His fear and anxiety was directed toward his son, Adolf Hitler. Alois gave his son brutal beatings and mental stress since he was the age of eleven or so. Adolf Hitler was taught that he was the one responsible to erase the Jewish line in his family, and even throughout Germany. Constant beatings brainwashed him.\\r\\n    From this historical fact, there is no possibility that Hitler is a person of good character. His brutal beatings were what made him brutal. The anxiety in him made him to find scapegoats, the Jews, as a race he could have his revenge on from his childhood traumas. Inside, Hitler was a person full of fear, anxiety, hate, and unstableness. \\r\\n     Like this, Hitler is a fine example of a leader who is not of good character. Hitler was a person of good eleoquence, determination, and strictness on the outside, but inside, he was full of anxiety and hate that came from his childhood trauma and fears of his too dictatorial father.\",\n",

       " ('The children of today are being taught frequently that money is valuable, which should be the goal of their lives. Children learn these concepts of money due to parent giving money as a prize for doing something valuable, such as doing chores around the house or getting excellent grades at school. However this concept of money can be harmful to our society and should be changed into making children see that money is merely an object.\\r\\n     Instead of giving money as a prize to children, money should be shown to children as a seperate thing from beneficial deeds that they accomplish. If money is given to children as a reward for something beneficial they do, than money might be mistaken to children as an object that is given to people who do right things. Therefore they would rate anything in the world according to money. For example a child, after he has grown up, would think that a job or a doing that offers a greater amount of money is more valuable than the ones that offers less money. But this might lead person into doing harmful things since all beneficial deeds in a society is not rewarded with a great amount of money.  Instead deeds that are evil are more regularly offered more money, such as bank robbing can get more money than working for a company. \\r\\n     The other way that economical education should be taken is by making children earn their own money. By giving children this education can make children see that money is not a reward for something good that they do, instead it shows that money is earned by hardwork. Therefore children realizes how hard money is to earn, which prevents them from wanting to earn money easily when they have become grown ups. Preventing children from wanting easily earned moeny is beneficial to our society since most easily earned money is made through evil deeds or through methods that does not help our society. Examples of this moeny earning can be lottery which makes people wish for almost the impossible and which does nothing to help our society.\\r\\n     Since many problems can be aroused by improper economiocal education of children, this situation should be considered more seriously. First of all we should remember to make children think that moeny is different from rewards given to people who have done good. Secondly children should be taught that money is an object that is not easily earned. By teaching these concepts properly, our society would improve by these future hopes of our country.',\n",

       " (\"Secrets are what people mostly gossip about. They are mysterious and they stimulate our curiosities. We tend to keep secrets if it is something we do not want to talk abbout, or if it is something that hurt us before. Are these secrets necessary in our lives, or are they harmful? I think that secrets have to exist for many reasons. \\r\\n     Secrets are needed in order to keep a close and tight relationship with someone. I have read a story before in which a boy did not tell his friends that he was homosexual. It was a big secret to him. However, someone exposed this information and the boy lost his friendship with his friends. Some could say that those friends were not real friends. However, the point in this argument is that the boy lost his intimate relationships, by the exposure of his secret. \\r\\n     Another reason why secrets are important is that they keep order between human beings. One reason why Napoleon could keep his leadership and keep everything in order was that he kept his foreign identity to himself. If he did not keep this hidden, people would not have obeyed him. People would have pointed and assailed him instead. Like this, people all have bad secrets, and if these secrets were all exposed, we would all be cursing one another and not listening to each other's works. There would be only chaos in this world. \\r\\n     The last reason why secrets are necessary is that we have a right to have secrets and hide information we do not want to talk about. It is not a matter of secrets being harmful to society. It is a matter of our basic rights. Maybe someone has had a experience of sexual harassment that hurt her. If she does not want to tell anyone about her past, she doesn't have to. \\r\\n     Secrets are necessary because they keep intimate relationships, keep order, and lastly, keep our basic rights to silence. In order to keep a democratic society in which people respect each others' rights, we must consider the existence of secrets in each and every person.\",\n",

The greatest thing I've learned was, though, to be meticulous in anything and everything that I do. \\r\\n    I was one of many students from our school who took independent study courses from Louisiana State University.  I took Spanish 146, which was the equivalent of second semester Spanish.  I had passed through the first semester, Spanish 145, with flying colors.  In 146, I had a 98% average, so I underestimated it and did not study for the final exam.  In fact, I barely glanced over the book.  My awesome memory would surely save me, wouldn't it?  The next day, I received my exam score - a 77%.  Because the final exam was to count for 30% of the total grade, there was no way I could come out of the course with an A.  Thanks to my carelessness, I had to re-enroll in Spanish 146, redo all of the assignments, and take the final exam again.  The experience not only costed money but also caused me to lose precious time.\\r\\n    As if I had not learned my lesson, I was in for another kick in the rear end when I took the rules test for my permit.  My friends had all told me that this test would be a joke.  Besides, how hard could it possibly be?  So I flipped through ninety pages of the rules book in about an hour and went to take the test.  Not surprisingly, I failed it, and the only possible explanation I could give was that I had not been meticulous when I studied the book.\\r\\n    Finally, the new SAT in March also gave me a huge jolt, and most likely, it was the last such mistake I'll ever mistake.  My friends studied diligently and tirelessly for this test.  I, however, chose to breeze through the practice book and was easy on myself when scoring practice tests.  When the real scores came in on April 11, my poor score reflected the amount of care I had put into my studying.\\r\\n    After having experienced three major failures due to carelessness, I have at last learned my lesson.  I cannot afford to be careless in anything I do, especially studying.  I am not a genius, and luck will not always be with me.  I must stop wasting time by being more meticulous, and hopefully, in the future, this lesson I have learned will help me succeed not on the second try, but on the first.\",\n",

However the thought that a person relying on technology to solve a problem will have their abilities corrupted is not convincing. Instead using technology for problem solving can help steer human's thinking ability to the maximum.\\r\\n     The way that technology can bring people's thinking ability up to their maximum is that technology is only an aiding material. Technology is an aiding material to humans since humans do all the primary thinking beforehand. An example of technology as an aiding material can be seen in the case of calculators. Many people think that calculators do the math problems for the users without any thought of the user taking place. However this is not true. People using calculators for abstruse formulas have to think in order to use the calculators. For calculators can not read nor can calculators analyze problems on their own.\\r\\n     The other reason that technology can not be seen as harmful to peoples ability to think is that technology has a limit. The limit of technology makes it impossible for people to rely on technology completely on solving problems. This limit is put on technology since technology is made by humans. The fact that humans have not become fully enlightened creates this limit. An example of this limit can be seen in robots, where their development to be humans is still awkward. \\r\\n     Many matters in technology makes it impossible for technology to deteriorate human ability. The fact that technology has limits and that technology only is an aiding method for human work shows how unrealistic people are, who think that technology used in solving problems corrupt human thinking. Therefore people should not worry about technology being detrimental, instead people should use technology  efficiently to improve our society.\",\n",

Although politics which can balance the ideal and realities of life may be the best one, if there is priority between them, the politics should focus on public discussion rather than an ideal. \\r\\n\\r\\n     First, politics can only be justified by performing policies based on people’s demand. People elect politicians to make them represent them and expect them to carefully hear people’s voices. And people put confidence on politicians if their claim is accepted and achieved as they wanted. Even the consensus of demand can be changed as time goes, the good relationship between politics and people is based on attitude of politics to carefully search reasonable consensus. For example, in 1970, Korean politics took his course to the economically well-developed country. Although politicians sacrificed development of other part like welfare of workspace and the protection of environment, they accomplished economical progression in short time. This satisfied Korean pretty much and also the president at that time was elected again by people’s encouragement. \\r\\n\\r\\n     Second, pursuing ideal excessively has chance to threat the harmony of society. An ideal needs a lot of premises which are almost impossible to accomplish in real world. To exemplify this, let me show the case of North Korea. This country is one of the communist countries and now it suffers from the serious food and medical problem. At first, North Korea tried to make ideal world which goods are distributed equally to everyone and have forced to follow the rule controlling freedom of speech. The trial to keep the ideal which could not notice the problem in the realities of life has proved to be a failure now. If their politics had collected public voices of remodeling the economic structure they would not have reached such a impoverishment. Like this, an ideal should be carefully accomplished by equilibrium with national consensus.\\r\\n\\r\\n     In sum, the politics should concentrate on searching public opinion at the present time. If people’s need doesn’t accord with ideal direction, the politicians should consider what is the best action for satisfaction, then try to get closer to an ideal. The reverse of steps would just result in politics without confidence.',\n",

However, it isn’t based on clear and logical assumptions and is not convincing either.\\r\\n\\r\\n     First, the author assumes that vandalism would be reduced by lighting in Amburg as the city of Belleville. This could be a bad analogy. Perhaps Amburg has enough intense light already, so it could be no use to lighten up street more than now. In addition, unnecessary lighting could burden higher tax on citizen and rather make citizens leave Amburg. Thus, if Amburg is not similar to Belleville, the author cannot reasonably expect the same outcome.\\r\\n\\r\\n     Second, the author also assumes that high intensity lighting is the major factor which can reduce vandalism effectively. However, there is no evidence that there is strong correlation between them. Maybe the reduced vandalism in Belleville could have been resulted from highly increased installation of CCTVs which are monitored by police. Therefore, if the intensity lighting is not the root cause, then there is no reason to expect that crime would be decreased.\\r\\n\\r\\n    Third, the argument concludes that reducing crime by lighting up could revitalize the city by increasing neighborhood. However, no one can sure that reducing crime could have effect on rise of population. Maybe the prices could be too high, or the water and air pollution could be severe to live long time in this city. Thus, population restoration may not come true if the crime is not the primary cause of low population.\\r\\n\\r\\n     In conclusion, the argument that Amburg can revitalize by lighting through out the city is not logically convincing as it stands. To strengthen the argument, the author should show the analogy of two city and the direct evidence that lighting can reduce the rate of crimes. And the argument would also need to demonstrate more clearly that high crime rate is the major factor on the population of Amburg.',\n",

While technology makes our lives more comfortable, technology also has the power to reveal our unwanted sides. Therefore use of technology should be carefully regulated in a boundary so that there is no harm done to our privacy.\\r\\n    The first step that people need to take in order to decrease privacy infringement is that everyone should be careful not to use his or her identity too freely especially on internet. By reducing the amount of information use on Internet of people would change Internet from a place where privacy was threatened to being a place where only wanted information gets traded.\\r\\n    The other way we can lessen infringement of people's privacy is by making a law that will regulate the use of technology. This regulation could be taken by reducing cameras on the street and also make anything on the Internet that could harm a person's privacy illegal.

Each time I picked myself up, I was more determined than ever to succeed next time.  All in all, there is no success like failure because each failure leads me to try harder.\\r\\n\\tOne memory of failure that usually strikes me first is one from elementary school, in first grade.  I had just moved to the United States, and my English was severely limited to phrases such as, “How are you?” or “Thank you.”  I had learned, “May I use the restroom?” the day before the first day of school.  I was slightly nervous and definitely anxious about my first day at an American school, and rightfully so, it seemed.  \\r\\n\\tMy teacher’s name was Mrs. Tedford.  She was a mean looking lady with frizzy red hair and glasses.  She towered over my four feet of height and boomingly called the role.  In addition, my classmates’ reactions to my not being able to speak English were terrible.  They made fun of me and called me names.  I was not used to crying in public, so I asked to be excused to the restroom.  There, I locked myself in a stall and cried with disappointment.  After awhile, I returned to the classroom with a fake smile plastered on my little face.\\r\\n\\tTrips to the restroom to cry became common practice for me.  I found refuge in the stalls, separated by wooden boards from the rest of the world.  I suppose Mrs. Tedford became annoyed with my more-often-than-frequent trips to the restroom.  One day at lunch, in the cafeteria, I could not stand my classmates’ torments any longer.  I stood up and asked to be excused.  Instead of her usual, growling, “Yes, you may,” I received, a harsh “GO!” with a hard push.  I fell and scraped my knee, but I blindly ran to the restrooms, eyes full of tears.\\r\\n\\tThe next morning, I sat down to eat breakfast before going to school, but I found that I really did not want to go back to school.  When my mother asked me what had happened, I tearfully told her what had happened.  She became furious, and my parents went to school to drop me out of school.  Hence, I became a first grade drop-out.\\r\\n\\tI returned to school after a couple of months, but this time, I was ready.  I had studied English while I was at home, and I could read well now.  I was determined not to let those other kids take advantage of me.  In fact, I was recommended to take the Gifted and Talented Program screening exam.  Unfortunately, I failed the screening exam.\\r\\n\\tHaving experienced failure before, I knew that the only thing I could do to pass that exam was to study hard.  I studied and studied until finally, I was able to pass the exam in the fourth grade.  \\r\\n\\tMy elementary school failure was merely one of numerous failures I have had in my life, but it was a memorable one.  I began school with a disadvantage of not being able to speak English, an ability that the other kids could take for granted.  I faced torments at school during every minute I was there, and finally, I dropped out of the first grade.  However, I brushed it off, after some time, picked myself up, and began again.  I strove for my best, and in the end, I was able to succeed.  Though I would rather not have to repeat such a failure, I am quite certain that if I had not failed from the beginning, I might never have done things I have done so far.  I am grateful for my successes today.',\n",

This success in stem-cell research has once again brought on the controversy over wether stem-cell research is morally right. Many people think using embryos to extract stem-cell is immoral since they consider embryos as human lives. However there are others who think embryos are non living organisms. Despite the dispute between embryos, stem-cell research is essential since improvement in stem-cell research would bring benefits to the norm of human.\\r\\n     The reason that research in stem-cell would be beneficial to our society is that all researches related to stem-cell are being carefully regulated by the government. Especially in countries like Korea the regulation of government is efficacious. The way this type of regulation becomes possible in Korea is due to the fact that Korea is small. Since every place can be covered in less than four hours, there can not be any secret researches going on. Therefore researchers have to work under strict government regulations in specific science labs, which makes it safe.\\r\\n     The main reason that stem-cell research could have on our society is by improving our medical science. Through duplications of stem-cells from human embryos people will be able to make parts of human's organs that could replace the actual ones in our body. Also there would be no side-effects for the person who gets the organs transplanted since the duplicated stem-cells can be fixed to have the same genetical codes. By this research people would be able to cure many terminal diseases such as heart diseases and cancers. \\r\\n     Through stem-cell researches, we have more to gain but less to lose. Through stem-cell researches people would be able to start a new revolution in medical science with no risks. Therefore stem-cell researches should be supported at all costs, and our society will be granted a bright future.\",\n",

       " (\"How to show anger is a very controversial topic. While some say one should express anger in the most emotional, violent manner possible, others say it is better to give a more subtle expression. Several ways exist in expressing anger. However, I prefer the more subtle methods, such as glaring or taking some time alone away from everyone. These methods allow an angry person to express anger without creating any trouble. It also makes it easier to make amends in the long run.\\r\\n   Many people get emotional when they get angry, and sometimes it is hard for them to act in a logical behavior. They want to shout obscenities, or worse, hit someone. However, this does more bad than good. Although the angry person might get initial gratification from the violence he generates more problems for himself. People who had been on good terms with him would become appalled by his irrational behavior, sparking new conflicts and creating new sources of anger. By exercising violence the angry person enters a vicious cycle of violence and conflicts. Although emotion might be hard to suppress, one must try to keep the matter as short as possible. He must not let it extend into other parts of his life.\\r\\n   Expressing anger not only has harmful effects on the person concerned, it influences other people as well. When people see an angry person, it influences the way they act. For example, one would shrink away before a fuming person. One angry person can influence others in such a way that they cannot do their job as efficiently as possible. An angry person is also frowned upon, and people who had been on good terms would begin to keep their distances away from the angry person. This is why one must try to keep one's anger to oneself as much as possible. \\r\\n   Subtle methods are just the way to minimize the impact anger has on society. Using such methods as glaring and taking sometime alone, one can keep anger to himself. Also, it is a great way to exercise self-control. Research says anger is one of the hardest emotions to keep under self control. By practicing controling anger, one can learn to control oneself in other, less stressful situations.\\r\\n   Expressing anger out loud has severe consequences both on the person concerned and the people around him. The initial gratification one earns is miniscule compared to the problems it brings. Therefore, it is wise to express one's anger in a subtle method, and to keep anger within oneself as much as possible. It is also a very efficient method to learn self-control. Expressing anger in a subtle method has great benefits.\",\n",

However, as time went by, the social pressure of not having a man with her to do her job, or the instability of the country made her take Phillp of Spain as her husband. The expectations the court had of a son as the next heir also made her have a child. This wasn\\'t her free will when she took the throne in the beginning. However, the social bounds of that time made her alter her actions. \\r\\n\\r\\n     Another example are the Jews. The Jews were persecuted all along, because of the fact that the Christian society did not like their religion. If they had perfect free will, they would have practiced their religion openly.This was absolutely not true. Social limits, such as the Spanish Inquisition or the Nazis made many of the Jews to convert to Christianity and throw away their religious faith. Social pressure has made their religion a sin, and thus, changing the way they think or behave. \\r\\n\\r\\n     I also have been experienced in this situation. I go to a \"prestigious\" private school in Korea, mainly because of my parents. I really wanted to be a soldier, but my whole family had expectations on me to be a great scholar or proffessor. These pressures I had since junior high just made me study harder, which wasn\\'t a thing I wanted to do, and made me enter this high school, which has a lot of competitive kids in it. I feel consented and happy now; however, I think that I might have been happier if my family did not have expectations on me and just let me do what I wanted.\\r\\n\\r\\n     These people I mentioned above, including me, had to sacrifice their free will, that is, what they really wanted, to satisfy society or make sure the socity\\'s expectations were fulfilled. These pressures made each one of these examples alter their thinking and behavior. They are just a few examples which show us that human beings cannot and will not have a perfect thing called free will in their lives. As long as we live together, we will asways have social boundaries limiting us.',\n",

I loved the sound of the heels clacking on the ground; it made me feel important and big, and in movies, the beautiful princesses always wore heels.  I never stopped dreaming of the day I would turn ten because my mom had promised to buy me the pair of high-heeled shoes I had been longing for as my birthday present.  I felt that with those shoes, I could be a princess too.\\r\\n\\tOn July 26, 1998, I finally turned ten years old.  My happiness was indescribable when I finally received those long-awaited shoes.  I tried them on and admired my feet for quite awhile.  \\r\\n\\tUnfortunately, it was summer vacation, and there was nowhere to go.  So I did not get to wear my new shoes anywhere or show them off to anyone.  The next day, however, was my piano lesson, and I could not wait to walk out of the house wearing those shoes.  I eagerly put them on and walked carefully to my teacher’s apartment.  Pathetically enough, her apartment was a few yards away from my family’s apartment, but I didn’t mind.  I was happy that I could show my new shoes off.  At first, I was cautious in taking my steps, but as I got used to the new elevation, I became more confident in my steps.  Soon I was skipping and jumping as well.  \\r\\n\\tSuddenly, I felt my right foot twist and there was a loud crash.  I found myself on the concrete, sprawled out.  Many of the neighbors stuck their heads out of their doorways to see what had caused the crash.  Some of the neighbors I knew started to laugh at me.  I was furiously blushing as I tried to limp to my piano teacher’s door.  \\r\\n\\tThat day I learned that princesses must go through a lot of trouble, and suddenly I didn’t really want to be a princess anymore.  My ankle hurt tremendously, and my neighbors would not let me live the embarrassing moment down for years after that.',\n",

Some of those immigrants are fortunate enough to have received English education in their home countries, but many of them did not have the same opportunities.  Some public schools offer ESL (English as a Second Language) Programs to non-English speakers, and I was one of those lucky individuals to receive the benefits of the ESL Program.  Though it is possible to hire English tutors, not all immigrants can afford paying for lessons.  Because not knowing English hinders foreign students, public schools should be required to give help by providing for them.\\r\\n\\tIt is often said that English is an extremely difficult language to master, largely because of the many grammatical rules and exceptions.  For Asians, the slurred pronunciation is definitely a difficulty, and the majority of immigrants who came to the United States at an older age speak English with an odd accent.  \\r\\n\\tEnglish tutors are available, but in many cases, immigrants cannot afford to pay for tutors.  Some immigrants were wealthy in their home countries and do not have to work as hard to support themselves.  Many of the wealthy immigrants probably had a chance to learn some English before coming to the United States.  However, many immigrants, such as those from third world countries, come to the United States to escape poverty, hunger, etc., with hopes to start a new life in the United States, but these immigrants probably did not have a chance to learn English.  \\r\\n\\tI came to the United States when I was six years old.  I was a fluent speaker of Korean, but I knew absolutely no English.  When I entered the first grade, I had an extremely hard time adapting to the new environment, let alone the new language.  However, I was fortunate, and my school, a public school, offered an ESL Program.  I was able to learn English fairly quickly, in comparison to many other Koreans who had come to the United States.  As a result, I was able to excel in my studies at school and soon accelerated to advanced courses.  I cannot begin to imagine the struggles that some people must go through without such benefits.  \\r\\n\\tThough it may seem unnecessary to those who can already read, write, and speak English, ESL Programs and other aids should be required to be given in public schools.

For example, when you run, if you are compete with someone, you can be a faster than running alone. As you can see, in society, if you are compete with someone, then you can be a more efficient.

Most people abhor failures, and blame themselves for the unfortunate experience. However, failure is not as an unfortunate event as people think. We can learn a lot from our mistakes, and also, get a chance to look back at how we are leading our lives. I agree with the statement 'there's no success like failure.' Our mistakes teaches us many valuable lessons, and guides us toward places we need to improve on. \\r\\n   Thomas Edison is an inventor famous for his many successful inventions that contributed to our society. However, he is also famous for an even bigger number of failures that led him to success. According to his autobiography, his most famous invention, the lightbulb was the product of years of countless failures. Edison later said that if he hadn't experienced those failures he never would have figured out how to create a lightbulb. Indeed, the key to Edison's many successes were even more failures.\\r\\n   Many of my achievements were also built on piles of failure. In middle school, I participated in a model glider contest. The glider that flew the farthest was to be the winner. Since every glider was to be made by the student himself, one's building skills often meant the difference between success and failure. I wanted to make the best glider; in order to do so I had to improve my skills. Prior to the contest I built dozens of gliders and tested each of them. Each crash and corkscrew taught me important lessons, and finally,  I learned how to build the best model glider. My failures paid off; I won the model glider contest.\\r\\n   There is an old saying, 'failure is the mother of success.' Without failure, we become arrogant. Thinking that we know it all, we get cocky, making ourselves vulnerable to very serious mistakes. With failures, we can prevent such an unfortunate demise. People shouldn't feel bad about making mistakes and failing. Failure is a part of the learning process, and a guarantee that we won't make that mistake again later.\",\n",

Here’s why I think there are more ways to succeed in life other than making lots of money.\\r\\nMany people can be defined as successful. Some are called successful because they achieved so much in their lives. To them, success isn’t about how much money they made. It’s about how much they have achieved. Take Shakespeare, for example. He is considered by many as a successful man, but was it because he made much money? No. I doubt he made as so much as a pound a day. He was successful because he achieved so much in his lifetime. He wrote a lot of famous plays like Hamlet, Romeo and Juliet, Lady Macbeth, and much more. His achievements made him successful.\\r\\nOthers are regarded as successful because they are highly honored. People who are in the Hall of Fame are considered successful not because they were lucrative, but because they were honored. Babe Ruth is a good example. Many see him as a successful man. However, it’s not because of his wages. He was honored as a great baseball player, and that is what made him successful. Being honored is another way to become successful.\\r\\nSome are viewed as successful because they contribute so much in their lifetime. No one doubts that Mother Teresa was successful, but was it because she made money? No. She made almost none at all. She was considered as successful because she lived a life that contributed so much to this world. Contribution is another road to success.\\r\\nOthers are successful because they live their lives with happiness. There are many people in this world who don’t make much money but are content with the way they live. Of all people, these are the ones that should be considered successful. They have acquired the ability to go through all kinds of hardships; happiness. Being happy with one’s life is the best way to become successful.\\r\\nThere are many ways to become successful in life. Some say that becoming profitable is the only way. However I think not. There are many other roads to success. Achieving much can be considered as being successful. Being highly honored is another method to become successful. Contributing much to this world is another way to become successful. However, above all, feeling content with the life you are leading is being successful. People nowadays are busily running around just to make a few more dollars. I think they should stop for a moment, and think about what it truly means to be successful.',\n",

In the end, however, history repeated itself; the Romans used the same tactic and crushed Hannibal’s efforts. Although Hannibal knew about the Roman tactics, he made the same blunders. History was doomed to repeat itself.\\r\\n\\tNapoleon attempted to punish Russia for not paying due compensations. He led a gigantic army into Russia, but due to failing supplies, the harshness of the Russian winter, and the harass of the Russians, he lost all of his soldiers and fell from power. Centuries later, Adolf Hitler made exactly the same mistakes. Operation Barbarossa was buried in the Russian snow along with 3 million German soldiers. It is interesting that Hitler was an admirer of Napoleon, and knew very well the strategic blunders that cost the French emperor his reign. Hitler’s knowledge didn’t prevent him from making the same mistakes. History again repeated itself against human knowledge.\\r\\n\\tAccording to some, “History is merely a record of mistakes mankind is doomed to repeat.” Historians have solved a number of historical mysteries and analyzed what went wrong where.

Many of the Talmud’s stories extol the wisdom of the old and condemn the ignorance of the young. In one story, a rabbi is taunted by a wealthy merchant. However, when thieves steal the merchant’s treasures, the rabbi advises the merchant, “The greatest treasure in life is knowledge.” It should be no surprise that in Talmud’s stories, age and knowledge frequently go together.

His misdeeds, for example, supplanting secret police officers  amist the people to find his opposers, were revealed in newspapers, magazines, and mass media.

Making tools out of stones, making weapons out of wood, or even using our hands for productive purposes can be called technology. Back then, technology only had benefits. However, today, advanced technology raises a lot of problems. Do the benefits of technology really outweigh the costs? \\r\\n     At the end of World War 2, the United States decided to throw the atom bomb, actually two atom bombs, at Japan. The United States had advanced technology coming from scientists all around the country and the world that helped the power of the atom bomb come to life. The important thing to the United States was that they had more advanced technology than Japan had, and thus they could win the big war. On the other hand, the cost of winnig this war, the benefit of technology, clearly did not outweight the costs. That is, the pricelss lives of millions of people. It is terrible to loose one invaluable life. However, it is worse to loose millions. Life itself was the most precious thing given to human beings, and because of technology, we lost an incountable number of these precious jewels. \\r\\n     During the Industrial Revolution, new technologies, such as making cars and steamboats were introduced. This lead to the building of \"factory towns\" where the majority of the town population worked in a factory nearby. These laborers had to work throughout the day in bad conditions, without inadequate sleep and rest. After years of labor, a lot of the people of \"factory towns\" had come down with illnesses in their throats, most leading to severe cancer. Again, what we see here is the humongous cost of technology. Factories can be seen as economically productive; however, the costs are the lives and illnesses of numerous human beings, beginning from children less than 7years old. This is certainly not the cost we have to pay for some new technology.\\r\\n     New technology will definitely also lead to new pollutants in our environment. These new pollutants may be unpredicted by scientists and we may not know how to reduce them. These toxic chemicals in the air, the water, and under the land will influence humans in a very negative way. Some might get pollutant-related diseases; some women will have genetically abnormal babies; and maybe one day we all might have to wear and buy oxygen masks just to survive. These are not costs we want to pay for new technology. As individuals, we do not sacrifice the health of our babies, or us, for a little progressiveness. We do not sacrifice the freedom to breathe freely for a little progressiveness. \\r\\n     As we can see, the benefits of new technology may be blatant for a short period. However, the costs will always outweigh the benefits in the long-run by affecting our health and our children. These are things that we definitely do not want to sacrifice.',\n",

While people consider independence the sign of maturity and good ability, being too independent is not effective, for it does not seem a wise choise. As we live with many other people, it is difficult to be absolutely independent and we can be stronger with the cooperation of others. The examples of the South Korean deplomacy of and my school show that too strong an adherence to independence is not wise.\\r\\n  South Korea is claiming their diplomacy as an imdependent policy. While South Korea has been in a solid alliance with the U.S. for a ling time, it is trying to be independent from the U.S. Also the South Korean president claimed the diplomacy war with Japan for Japanese claim on Korean island, Dokdo. China is hostile in diplomacy versus Korea because there has been a conflict for history. North Korea is still a military enemy, even though mutual relationship is improving. This is not independence bt isolation. Idependence diplomacy itself sounds good. Korean people are very ashamed of their status as a satellite state of the U.S., so theu passionately supported 'independence diplomacy.' But it is not wise to be isolated in the international arena. \\r\\n   Another example of false independence, my school is one of the most famous ones in South Korea. There are a few private boarding schools in Korea and my school is in top rank. It was the richest may be, because the milk company sponsered our school. The students didn't have to give much money to school. And there were many luxurious facilities. But one day the company stopped its support. There was no money from outside the school. Then the students had to pay tuition so as to guatantee the functions of the school. But student's fees were not enough and the school facilities became worse. At that time, the school board calimed its independence. They said that they would not rely on other big companies and run school with student;s payment and some donations. THe school hboard didn't want their school to be used by commercial groups. But that independance increased the financial crises in school.\\r\\n  The above two examples of Korean diplomacy and my school, I proved that we sometimes have to give up independence to be more strong.

For him, behaving in the way he set for himself was crucial for maintaining his health, having cordial relationships with others, and accomplishing his daily goals.\\r\\n\\r\\n              Franklin's behavior can be explained with Maslow's theory of motivation.  According Maslow's hierarchy of needs, basic biological drives such as hunger and thirst, are the lowest level of needs.  On the top of the hierarchy is the need for self-actualization.  In between are the need to feel secure and be loved.  Although people may vary in which need they value more, I found myself changing as Maslow's theory. Usually, I eat three meals at a set time.

Sexual orientation is also innate, and people cannot blame other human beings for the innate qualities they were born with.\\r\\n     Many research papers on homosexuality show that genes play a relatively large part on making one individual homosexual. Identical twin studies have shown that almost 80% of identical twins shared homosexual orientation, meaning that if a one was gay, there was a high chance that his identical twin brother would be homosexual, too.

The funny thing is that no one condemns them for eating pork although it is obviously shown in the Old Testament that eating pork is against the will of God. All sins have been forgiven because of Jesus Christ, and this is basically what Christians hold as their fundamental logic. \\r\\n     Homosexuality is something people are born with. Just as people have characteristics like large eyes, big noses, small mouths, homosexuality is just a part of a human being. Although I am Christian myself, I think that homosexuality can be justified because we have been forgiven our sins that were mentioned in the Old Testament when Jesus came to our world, and anything can be forgiven now as long as you repent. Thus, homosexuality is justifiable, and no one has the right to criticize these outcasts for their abnormal qualities.',\n",

Our wireless network also depended on electricity so all computers were disconnected to the internet. The check-up lasted only three hours, but three hours seemed like three years.

Students had become used to the comfort of such fast services that they now lacked the patience to wait for just three hours.\\r\\n\\r\\n           Advanced technology has changed more than our behavior. The malfunctioning of machines, the outcome of advanced technology, has injured or killed people. On the news, we can occasionally gather that a person died because the elevator suddenly dropped or a group of students were injured on their bus ride to a field trip. Rapid changes in technology have caused the environment to change to produce more machines, factories have replaced mountains, the home of many flora and fauna.  People need a healthy environment to live but these changes do not allow people to benefit from nature.\\r\\n\\r\\n              Although changes are inevitable to make our lives more comfortable and pleasant, too much change can be harmful. Humans continue to research to discover more possibilities to improve their life conditions.

It sounds boring, but I have to say that I really earned a lot from this independent research project. \\r\\n     \\r\\nSometimes we stayed up late at school to rebuild our experimental set because our old one kept killing the poor fish and the water temperature would not increase properly. But the moment that I remember the most was when we worked for twelve hours straight and saw the sun rise out of the window as soon as we finished our research paper for some contest.  \\r\\n\\r\\nA year and a half passed by since we started the project, and finally, we completed the first draft of our research paper. My partner and I entered it in the Samsung Research Paper Competition. But I was shocked to know that our paper was turned down right from the preliminaries. We felt that a year and a half’s work had vanished into air. But these were times when we had to realize that we had been too arrogant and too pride of our achievements. This experience surely made us more modest than before.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe modesty we earned from the competition was probably the main factor that made us work harder and improve the quality of our research paper. After six more months of editing, the paper showed great improvement and was accepted to various international conferences, including IEEE, the largest conference in the world. It won awards in the local and national science fairs. It was also published and indexed in the SCI-Expanded online. \\r\\n\\r\\nBut these were “external” achievements and they do not tend to last long. What last until now are the facts that although my partner and I did not write the whole research paper ourselves (due to the fact that we were still unprofessional high school students), we were still a major part of the whole project and we still learned how hard it was to be a scientist.  \\r\\n\\r\\nBefore I started this project the only intellectual achievement I had were some high grades on my midterms which I studied for two weeks. I had never invested two whole years on one project. But most importantly, I shrieked at the pleasure that I was not the one using and taking advantage of knowledge that someone discovered already; I was the person who was discovering new knowledge and reproducing it as a research paper so that people could use it and learn from it in the future.',\n",

Students may be motivated to receive better grades for additional allowances from their parents, Honor Roll from school, or have the opportunity to give a valedictorian speech. Adults may be motivated to work diligently for a promotion, increased salary, or the mere satisfaction of accomplishment. Historically, one can notice what motivated famous people to act in that particular way. Martin Luther is a paragon of a person who acted accoring do his conscience and Hitler is an example of a person who failed to do so.\\r\\n\\r\\n           In Europe during 1500s, common people were losing faith in God. Corrupt clergy sold indulgences, tickets to heaven and neglected the decreasing faith among believers. Church services were held in latin, rather than the vernacular. Even if the less educated people wanted to learn God's words, they could not understand the sermon. Realizing such inconvenience, Martin Luther translated the Bible into German. In addition, he naield the 95 Theses on the door the church. He listed what the church was doing wrong. This bold act of Martin Luther partly caused the Reformation but also resulted in Luther's excommunication. Luther was cognizant of the latter outcome but he still acted according to his conscience. His boldness allowed a positive change to occur in the European society.\\r\\n\\r\\n           In contrast to Luther's boldness, Hitler's boldness wreaked havoc rather than helping the Germans. With careful planning to obtain power, Hitler turned from a unrecognized leader to a despotic leader. Blaiming the Jews, gypsies, and other non-aryans, he grasped the attention of Germans. Instead of trying to maintain amicable relationships with other countries, Hitler led his people to take over nearby countries. The second world war was initiated by the assassination of the Austrian heirn but the war was supported by Hitler. However, this war did good to no one. At the end of the war, Germany's economy was in a worse condition than the economy before the war. Hyperinflation caused Germans to be troubled again.\\r\\n\\r\\n           Luther and Hitler are both famous men but the former is highly respected while the latter is severely criticize to this day. Luther was conscious of the problems in his society but Hitler acted to gain power and take innocent people as scapegoats to obtain such power. These two men show how conscience of a person is important factor of a positive motivation.\",\n",

Even though most news focused on the criticism that an American pig bought the pride of English soccer fans, there was a short take on Glazer, himself. He is a son of a Jewish Lithuanian immigrant. When his father died, he only got three hundred dollars. But he worked hard, and expanded his business. Finally in 1990s, he bought an oil company owned by the Bush family. After that, he became even richer. In an interview, he said he usually wears twenty-dollar jeans. But his son usually wears two-hundred-dollar Calvin Klein jeans. Malcolm got money through the struggle of many decades, but his son only got money from him. Malcolm saves and is thrifty about money more than his son, because he knows the value of money better. \\r\\n\\r\\nAnother example, two of my classmates in middle school were very smart, but one was smart. When I was in first grade of middle school, the smarter guy got the first place in the first mid-term exam. He did not study much but he did well just because he was smart. The less smart guy got the second place and he was very frustrated. He studied so hard to get first place in final term test, but he failed again. The smarter guy also successed with little effort, although the gap between them reduced. Finally in the next term, the less smart guy got the first place. The smarter guy was not frustrated because he thought that he could one day get the first again with some fortune. But the less smart guy didn't lose his place became he kept struggling to keep his place. \\r\\n\\r\\n  The above two examples show that one values more what one obtained with difficulty.

Humans are supposed to eat meat, and it is because we have no other choice.\\r\\n  Humans eat meat because of many reasons, but the main reason is because meat taste good. If you ask a normal person walking by, and offer them a salad or a steak, most people will choose steak, unless that person is a vegetarian. If you leave out both the radical meat eaters, and vegetarians, most people will choose the steak. If you ask them why, they will give basically two reasons. The first reason is because a steak, taste better than a bowl of salad, and the second reason is because a steak is much more expensive than a bowl of salad.\\r\\n  It is human nature to eat meat, and is proved not only because they prefer meat over vegetables, but because the human body requires meat in order to survive. Meat provides alot of protein, and for the human body to develop muscles, alot of protein is needed. Meaning, that humans need to eat meat in order to develop muscles. Also, because meat provides many different vitamins at the same time, meat is a very crucial thing to the human body.\\r\\n  Humans have to eat meat.

Knowledge is very crucial to survival, enabling you to find a method to survive. Therefore, a survivor must be patient and smart.\\r\\n  Survivors should be able to control their feelings when they face extreme situations. Panicking doesn't help in many ways. For example, if you find yourself face-to-face with a snake, screaming would just upset the animal, making it bite at you. When calm, a person can look around better, which eventually helps survival. In other words, one should not be too emotional at bad situations.\\r\\n  Knowledge is another important element for survival. Without any knowledge, you wouldn't be able to live long. For example, you find yourself on an island with a knife, and you see trees around you. You see that there is a bigger island that has a village not far from your position. You would know that you should make a raft out of the trees around you, but if you don't know how to make a raft, all the plan would be useless.

Did they have no other choice, but to kill some one else\\'s father, brother, husband, or child? Of course not. People justify wars, but actually the truth is, that wars can never be justified.',\n",

       " ('People make choices and they all differ in what they consider to be the best solution.  This is because the situation and environment each is situated in are distinct.  Therefore, the ‘perfect solution’ works only for one individual (and perhaps some others in alike coincidences.)  In other words, there is no universal foolproof plan, unless it concerns a single person.  Further, this ‘perfect solution’ is likely to be transient and might turn into a no-so-perfect plan in the course of one’s lifetime, depending on subsequent decisions one makes and change in one’s position.  Then one would question the validity of one’s initial ‘perfect plan’, becomes skeptic of it, negating almost every good aspect it has brought and begins to question oneself what if one had done this instead of that.  Thus, a solution can never be perfect, considering all the occurrences that might alter one’s life and providing that nothing is ever static against time.  The tragic death of Romeo and Juliet, the ‘hypothetical facts’ in scientific books, and my life prove my argument.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe infatuated young couple’s perfect plan was detrimental to their reunion and destroyed every bit of hope of happiness.  Juliet carried out the monk’s plan perfectly: She drank the magic potion and as able to fake her death, avoid marriage and lie in peace waiting for her love Romeo.  Unfortunately, Romeo was not so well informed of Juliet’s doings and kills himself before Juliet’s coffin, devastated and outraged of his lover’s unexpected death.  Minutes follow and Juliet wakes up as schedules under the monk’s ‘perfect plan’ but is horrified at the sight of Romeo’s suicide.  Realizing that her future is devoid of happiness, now that her love is gone, she has her fate with him.  The monk who so carefully planned out everything suddenly finds himself standing before the two lovers’ cold bodies.  The perfect plan was sadly a complete failure.\\r\\n\\r\\nEven in real life, the word perfect never applies to anything.  For example, scientific books contain seemingly substantiated facts and universal truths that ultimately explain the workings of the Earth.  School teaches those facts and students are made to accept them as principle of the universe, since a scientific fact, they are taught, are purely scientific; it is misunderstood that scientific anything makes anything true.  That said, one has to understand that no science is perfect and ever truthful.  Science is merely a set of validated hypotheses that scientists dub to be ‘facts’ but are really undisputed assumptions and hypotheses not yet negated.  A perfect solution thus does not exist.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy life also advocates my argument that no plan is perfect.  Of all the plans I have made to perfect my life, not one has fulfilled its mission.  My grandiose New Year’s plans, for example, had to be modified severely in response to changes that occurred as time passed.  Not that a New Year’s plan is never beneficial but simply that a ‘perfect plan’ does not result in perfection.  The same applies to relationships: When I expect a flawless relationship and try to avoid all kinds of disputes, more disagreement arise than when I embrace the other’s vices and accept my own faults.  The latter relationship tends to last longer and becomes part of my happy memories afterwards.  Life cannot be perfect and so can’t the foolproof plans I carry out.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor every so-called final answer there is another way of seeing things.  There is always an alternative, or a Plan B.  The vicissitudes of one’s life prevent Plan A from being perfect but in case things fail miserably, there is always a Plan B to better them.',\n",

Of course, this was in the past. Now, we poison the prisoners, wishing to give them a peaceful death. There are three fluids injected into the prisoner. The first one makes the prisoner fall asleep, the second one makes the prisoner\\'s heart stop, and the last one is another type of poison that is supposed to make the prisoner\\'s heart stop. But, is this death penalty the best way to prevent murderers from killing? Maybe not.\\r\\n\\r\\n   Since the past, people have been making sets of laws in order to protect themselves from each other, in order to keep their properties to themselves, and so that society will not turn its\\' back against them. However, did laws stop all this? No, it did not. Laws gave people the idea that \"If I do something bad, I will get punished.\" But this was only limited to \"when\" the out law got caught. After that people started thinking. \"Then what would happen if I did something bad, something against the law, and was able to get away with it? Never get caught?\" People tried, some failed, and some succeeded. This is the same with the death penalty. If you look at it, the death penalty is only \\'one\\' type of law, and killing one another is a way to do something against the law.\\r\\n\\r\\n   People got away with murder in a variety of ways. The first way is to run away to a different country, hide for a period of time, and return. This way, the police have no way to investigate, for the criminal is already \"gone\". The second way is to simply not leave any evidence. Committ the crime carefully, and thoroughly that people think it is simple suicide, or so that people get confused and never find out who committed the crime. The third way, is to run away to another state, and get caught. Some states have the death penalty while some other states do not. Which means, if you killed someone in one state where the death penalty exists, run away to some other state where the death penalty is illegal, get caught, and live your life in jail instead of being injected with three different types of fluids.\\r\\n\\r\\n   Like this, the death penalty is not the best protection from a murderer. The reason is because the criminal can easily avoid the death penalty by simply going off to another state, or another country. Of course they will if they have to, because they know that running and hiding, is better than death. Law was made in order to \"prevent\" bad things from happening, but eventually turned out to, \"clean up\" what has happened by punishing others. Just like a Korean saying, \"The fist comes first, and then comes law.\"',\n",

Truth is the harsh way of facing reality; so people resign to illusion, by choosing to be decepted by deliberate lies, or white lies. Whether this decision is unconsicous or intentional I do not know, but it is certain that lies are acceptable (to a certain degree), under the condition that the negative effects of truth outweigh its benefits.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy aunt, Diane, recently passed away, not knowing that she had only a few weeks left. Because my overwhelmed uncle thought it wise to hide the doctor's unpromising words from my aunt, she could not prepare for her death. He thought that the devastating news would remove all hopes of recovery and make Diane become pessimistic. He had heard from a psychiatrist that hope was the key to overcome a disease and was advised to keep her from knowing her aggravating health.\\r\\n\\r\\nThanks to my uncle's relentless care or by luck alone, Aunt Diane seemed to be fortifying day by day. She began to make plans for the future, such as redecorating the living room and learning a new language. Up to this moment, my uncle was very satisfied with Diane's recovery and did not find it necessary to let her know the doctor's sentence. My uncle had prevented me from informing her the real situation and thus I could only observe my fragile aunt from behind.\\r\\n\\r\\nWeeks the doctor had predicted had passed and my aunt was in a crisis. She did not recognize my voice or that of her husband and refused to continue the chemotherapy she had been going through, claiming that she could not bear the pain any longer. Her health exacerbated rapidly and her body rejected all kinds of medicines. A few days later she passed away, not having shared the kisses and the goodbyes with her family, If my uncle had told her the gravity of her health without overly dramatizing the situation, my aunt would have had time to prepare her death. \\r\\n\\r\\nTruth has the redoubtable quality of reality but when circumstances favor otherwise, lying is justified.

In situations when there are many chances, this sentence works, but in circumstances with very crucial opportunity, this doesn't work. Therefore, success can begin with failure when there are many chances,\\r\\n  When there are many tries, failure can have good effects. For example, let's say that you are trying to set up your set of dominoes. You would somtimes wreck the whole set by some tiny mistake. But since nobody said the limits of your chances, you would be able to try again. Unlike the former tries, you would have experiece in building dominoes. Finally, you would succeed in finishing the whole field of dominoes. This shows that the unlimited number of opportunity gives the challenger experience, which eventually leads him to success.\\r\\n  On the contrary, important chances might have a side effect. In Korea, there is a big annual exam that you have before you go to the university. Many parents pray for their childrens' luck. Where there are students who went into the university they wanted, there are others who failed. This failure might give experience, but these people receive disadvantages when they apply for companies to get employed. In other words, failing can be dangerous in important situations.\\r\\n  Failure has two different meanings. The first is a way to succeed. Failure can give experience, making success easier to achieve. On the other hand, it can be a stone of depression. failure might give disadvantages. In my opinion, the best way to be a successor would be to do your best in every situation.\",\n",

Public transportations can save time, money, and energy sources.\\r\\n\\t Public transportations can save time because they carry more people than personal vehicles. If many people are using the public transportation, then there will be fewer cars on the road. So, in big cities like New York, San Francisco, or Chicago, the amount of traffic can be reduced significantly. Of course, if there is no traffic, time can be reduced significantly. This is important in U.S. because so many people own personal vehicles, and not many people uses public transportations, which causes a terrible traffic jam in big cities. With less traffic, police and fireman can get to the emergency place quicker. This can save people’s life.\\r\\n\\tSince public transportations can carry more people, they can save money and energy sources. Cars need gasoline to move. However, there is only finite amount of gasoline left in the world, and as amount of gasoline gets less, the price gets more expensive. So, if we compare gas price to years ago, we can notice right away that the price skyrocketed. Now, think about this: 50 cars each carrying a person travels 100 miles, and a bus carrying 50 people and travel 100 miles to the same destination. Approximately, in this situation, 98% of money or gasoline can be saved. Why? Because it actually is a comparison between 50 cars traveling 100 miles, and a car traveling 100 miles. Of course, I ignored the fact that buses use more gasoline than car, but still, one bus will use much less gasoline compared to 50 cars. Anyway, think of all of those saved money getting used to improve people’s life. For example, making park, making roads and highways, making school, etc. Wouldn’t it be great? \\r\\n\\tAlso, as I mentioned above, there is only finite amount of gasoline in the world. This means that someday, we are going to use it all. However, since 98% of gasoline can be saved by using public transportation, people might be able to use gasoline 50 times longer. Why is gasoline so important? Think about a world without gasoline. Not only you will not be able to travel far, but also there will be not much of electricity generated because about 50% of electricity is generated by heating water from burning gasoline. Also, without gasoline, we might not be able to survive through cold winter. In addition, countries that rely highly in trade market can get serious financial problems because without gasoline, no transportation would work.\\r\\n\\tSo, improving public transportation is very important. They can save time, which can be critical factors in emergency situations. Public transportation also saves money, which can be used to many other beneficial things. Finally, public transportation saves energy sources that can make our life miserable if none exist.',\n",

Also, when young, people might lose themselves to temptations, increasing the rate of crimes. People should be mature enough to own a gun.\\r\\n  Let's suppose you gave a small toy to a kid. After some time, you might find the boy without the toy. The boy may say that he lost it while at the playground, etc. Like this, children lose things well. When a kid possesses a gun, he has a risk of losing it. Then somebody who knows how to use it would pick it up. If that person is someone kind, there won't be any problems. But if a criminal picked it up, the situation gets worse. The criminal might start shooting people. A person who owns a gun should be wise enough not to lose the gun.\\r\\n  When immature, you sometimes lose your mind to something that attracts you. There are times when you control it, but sometimes you just go for it. This is very dangerous when having a gun in your hand. You might just run for a killing spree. Not only does this kill people and ruin your life, but it might trigger others. So it might turn out to be a domino between the teenagers with guns. Owning a gun when not able to restrain oneself should be prohibited.\\r\\n  Weapons can never be safe. But if one should be possessed, safety should be ensured as much as possible.

My disabled but hopeful friend is another example of my argument.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy choosing how to react to our own sins, we determine whether we will be forever doomed or happy. The heroine in The Scarlet Letter has committed adultery with the pastor and is being openly rebuked by the public. The pastor hides his immoral actions and denies any connection to the heroine. Even though she is clearly unjust, she decides to take matters with complacency, without being to harsh to herself. She knows that she has committed a serious crime and yet she does not let her emotions be controlled by the outraged public. On the contrary, the stealthy pastor is torturing himself of his unspeakable sin and let guilt take over his sanity. He has lost all hopes and this leads to his self-destruction.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have a beloved friend of 13 years. Not only have the years fastened our friendship but also have made a great impression to me. Daniel was a passionate and influential student in the school. He was a great sportsman and won trophies in many subjects yearly. Simply put, he was loved by all. One day, as he was practicing ice hockey before a final match with his school's ever-competing rival, a fellow player accidently struck his head with a hockey stick. I was astonished when he fell miserably on the ice link stiff like a brick of wood. The ambulance was called and he lost conscience for several days. The doctors were pessimistic of his condition. When he finally woke up, he was not the Daniel I used to know. His brain damage had left him half paralyzed and he was not the brightest person in the world. Although it is hard to label him a handicap, considering his optimistic ourlook and eagerness, he is in a wheelchair unable to sustain himself with ease. He would never be able to play sports like he used to and cheer up his teammates as a captain but he is doing an equally worthy thing, if not better; he counsels those in his situation and help them regain confidence, goes to rehabiliation center without a complaint, smiles at all those who are distressed, comforts those needy, contributes to the community services, and considers those less fortunate than himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe woman who has committed adultery in The Scarlet Letter redeems herself of her greatest grief by choosing to decide her own fate. Instead of repenting and being hopeful, the pastor chooses to suffer from his utter sin. Likewise, Daniel decides to confront his challenge with a postive mind and thus prevents from a could-be greatest grief into turning a real greast grief. Therefore, it is right to say that the greatest griefs are those we cause ourselves. It i\",\n",

People who survive in the competition have better chances using more resources and live have better life.  Then, what is an indispensable thing that makes individuals win the competition?  It is willingness to change according to the situations.\\r\\n  When I went to the Jeju Island, I heard personal experiences from farmers.  The farmers used to grow pineapples and bananas.  However, they failed as the pineapples and bananas from the Philippines were much cheaper and had better tastes.  To survive, the farmers had to squeeze out the ideas.  They thought about the tangerine, which is size of a plum.  The tangerine tasted better than other ones.  Now they are exporting the tangerines all around the world.  The farmers were willing to change and they were able to survive in the market.\\r\\n  In ecosystem, there are millions and millions of animals.  Those animals also were willing to change, which is called evolution, and that's why they are still alive.  One of the examples is bears.  A group of bear occasionally had to live in cold weather.  To avoid freezing and slipping, the bears grew thicker furs on their body and more friction on their feet.  That is how they became a polar bear.  The bears evloved according to their surroundings and they still survive in North Pole.\\r\\n  Nothing is immutable.  Nowadays, technology grows faster and faster.  People have to accept their surroundings and be willing to change according to their surroundings.  The one who is willing to change can only survive in this complex and competitive world.\",\n",

Though many people claim that the environment is becoming worse, wr have hope in our future. The two examples of neuclear power supply and Dong river in Korea show that our damaging of the earth will not last forever.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the most influential sources of pollution has been fossil fuel which has been the main power source since Industrial revolution. ANd from then, air pollution began. Fossil fuels, coal and oil, produce many harmful gases during burning. Then, new energy sources appeared: neuclear energy, for instance. This source of energy was surely dangerous. And accident, like the one at Three mile island power plant, happened. But the cance of accidents is very small. Also the side-product of neuclear power is not so harmful if it is kept safely. That's why neuclear power is claearer and better that fossil fuels, even though some people oppose that it is worse energy source. Technical improvement brought a new energy, and future improvements will bring more energy sources like sun light which are safer and cleaner.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother example is Dong river of Korea. Dong River was one of the cleanest rivers in Korea. It had many rare fishes and birds. But one day the government announced a plan to build a dam on Dong River. They said the dam will be beneficial for a more national distribution of water. But many conservationists and ecologists opposed to this plan. They proved the bad effects that the dam woud cause through the computer simulation. Their opposition to the dam construction moved many people who were already aware of ecology and conservation. Finally, many people sidedwith the ecologists and the plan was cancelled. Because of the awareness of people to environment, it is now move easily kept.\\r\\n\\r\\n  Though above two examples of saving environment, I showed that our environment will not be worse forever. The technology for saving environment is improving and the awareness of people toward the environment is increasing. The earth's ecology will be preserved.\",\n",

Altogether it is very good for the environment. \\r\\n\\r\\nThere are reasons why a zoo serves good purposes for humans. \\r\\nFirstly, people can learn about animals when they visit a zoo. Exotic or not, usually animals are hard to reach. If you have a zoo, you can visit it much easier than actually going to the place where animals live. You don't have to travel all the way to rain forests or deep seas to see particular animals. Almost every animal you want to see exists in a zoo. A student of biology can study animal behaviers in a zoo. Even experts can visit a zoo to study about animals. \\r\\n\\r\\nSecondly, it is a good place for people to get closer to animals. That is very important because it makes people think about animals and their habitats when people are doing something that concerns nature. Let's say someone is about to build a factory. The person who is close to animals will think about  the effects the factory can make to the environment. They are likely to build a factory that doesn't harm the habitat the animals live. On the other hand, if a person is not close to animals, the person might build factories that  ruin the environment. If the environment is ruined, in the end it is the humans that are badly effected. \\r\\n\\r\\nA zoo can also help animals. It can serve as a shelter that protects endangered species. The experts can take endangered injured animals to a zoo and heal them. Experts could also make endangered species grow bigger in number and set them back to the wild. \\r\\nIt can help animals by  making experts know how to treat animals when they are young or hurt. Experts will be able to save more animals in the wild by learning that in a zoo. \\r\\n\\r\\nSome people might argue that  a zoo is only a place where animals are locked inside bars and cages. I think many zoos now are much developed from the ones before that had bars. Many zoos are safaries, which gives animals almost wildlife like habitat. I think after some years most zoos will turn into safaries that give animals maximum amount of freedom. \\r\\n\\r\\nThose are the reasons why I think a zoo have a lot of purposes.

However it is always bound to have leakages, flaws and errors.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor example, the belief that the universe worked under a geocentrical orbital system was a popular misconception in the 1600's. The brightest minds of sciences, ordinary people, and especially the catholic church believed that God had placed earth in the center of the universe and that all other planets, even the sun, revolved around the earth. For an adequate duration, may conceived this idea to be true, perfect and impeccable. However, when Galileo stepped in to the scientific field, impugning the consenseus, most people rejected his idea and his attempts to be futile. But a few decades later, as it turned out that Galileo's theory was indeed correct, people realized that they shouldn't just accept an idea or a solution without ever refuting or rebutting. This is a clear and irrefutable example in whose it is apparant that there isn't just one perfect solution.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn one of my favorite books, The Sky is Falling, the author Sidney Sheldon writes about the theme of nuclear fuel as a source of energy, as well as talking about the other point of view, nuclear fuel as a menas for terrorits to gain political power.

However, the terrorists had another point of view; to use plutonium as a bomb to gain control of the Vatican City.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are countless examples to further show that these are multiple solutions to a problem.

This shows that most of the time, if not always, there are multiple ways in which human being can construe a circumstance and hence carry out his or her act accordingly.\",\n",

       " (\"I think it is better for children to grow up in a big city. If they live in the countryside, they won't easily mingle with the social community when they grow up. There are two big reasons.\\r\\n\\r\\nFirstly, children would lack the opportunity to experience variety of cultures. In the countryside, there are few people who live there. Most people do farm work. When someone's working is limited, the mind is limited. The variety of mind determines the variety of cultures. Children will grow up looking only at farmers, which could make their site narrow. Also, if children grow up in the countryside, they are less likely to see exibitions or watch musicals etc. Usually countryside is far away from museums, theatres and many other cultural centers. It will be very hard for families who have children there travel far to see an exibition or any other cultural events. \\r\\n\\r\\nSecondly, living in the countryside would make it harder to exchange information. 21 century is the age of information. If you don't have enough information, there is less chance of achieving something you want. People might argue that even in the countryside there are computers that help exchange of information. However helpful computers are, children in the countryside would lack the exchange of informaion among people.  There are much more people living in a big city than in the countryside. There are informations you cannot find on the computer. In that case it would be much better for children to live in a big city and learn to exchange information. If children don't pick up the ability to exchange information when they are young, they are likely to be excluded in adult social communities in big cities.\\r\\n\\r\\nThose are the reasons I think can be crucial when deciding where to raise children. Human beings are social animals. For that reason it seems wiser to let your children experience variety of cultures and learn to exchange information, which would lead them to successful mingling and adapting to social groups later on.\",\n",

The same process should be used in the decision to allow or ban smoking. Since there are more people who do not smoke, smoking should be banned in public places and office buildings. If public smoking is banned, people’s lives and properties can be saved. For example, trashed cigarettes often cause severe fire, which can destroy even big buildings. Big buildings are expensive, and it contains many people, so such fire will bring a digester.

Also, there won’t be any kinds of smell related to cigarette, which will make air in public places cleaner.\\r\\n\\tWhy is the number of people who smoke smaller than the number of people who do not smoke? The reason is that smoking is harmful to humans due to the carcinogens in cigarettes. As a result, people who smoke suffer from many different cancers; these cancers often kill people who smoke. Also, to cure cancers caused by smoking, people spend a huge amount of money. In addition, a recent study found that indirect smoking is also as dangerous as direct smoking.

Unfortunally, during the battle of Noryang in 1598 he was shot by the enemy’s sniper and ended his short life in the middle of the battle. \\r\\n\\r\\nI learned many things from Yi. First of all, he was a patriot who truly loved his country. After the beginning of the Seven Year War, citizens including the soldiers and even the empire fled the country.  However Yi and his troops remained in the Korea Sea to fight the invaders. Patriotism wasn’t the only component that inspired me, he’s warm hearted mind, charismatic and discreet attitude inspired me the most. \\r\\n\\r\\nYi was the leader of millions of troops, one astonishing fact is that Yi knew every each one of his soldier’s name and their background life. It’s not easy to see a leader memorizing the names of his soldiers. While the soldiers worked, Yi also helped them. Also his discreet personality made plans for the battle. These factors improved the morale which gave the soldiers the confidence that they could win the battle. These abilities of Yi Sun Sin made him the most respected person in Korea. \\r\\n\\r\\nNow days people often say “all we need is one true leader who will be able to take care of millions of people.” Other than leadership I believe Yi’s patriotism, warm hearted mind and discreet attitude are other components of becoming a true leader. Getting to know Yi was the most valuable thing in my life. I was able to get a step closer of becoming a true leader.',\n",

       " ('There is a banal saying “Failure is the mother of success.” As we all know failure is an important stage that brings us a step closer to success. From failure we are able to gain experience, improvement in planning, and encouragement in lateral thinking. History isn’t an exception, sometimes the outcome of plans that led to failure brings greater benefic than success. The most suitable example is the Easter Rising which happened in 1916 in Ireland. By looking at this event I agree with the quote above. \\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the early 1800s Ireland was a part of Britain. The political groups were divided into two; Sinn Fein and IRB who wanted to have Home Rule, and Ulster Unions party who wanted to remain a part of Britain. The group did everything to prevent each other from getting their goal accomplished. \\r\\n\\r\\nOn April 24th to 29th in 1916 and Easter Rising have arose. The rebels composed of Irish Volunteers and citizen army had a fight against the British soldiers that were in Dublin. The rebel’s goal was to capture the Dublin castle which was the British Headquarter however as more British reinforcement arrived the rebel failed to achieve their goal in six days. \\r\\n\\r\\nAt first the citizens saw the Easter Rebels as foolhardy and misguided who should be imprisoned. However the indiscreet way the Britain executed the rebels changed public feeling. The Rebels were inferred in to consecrated ground and even the injured rebels were forced to sit on a chair and were executed. These heinous and inhumane actions of Britain changed the views of the citizens, who started to portray the rebels as nation heroes who fought for their country. Due to the change of the public feelings Ireland was able to pressure Britain for their Home Rule and eventually succeed.  \\r\\n\\r\\nIf the Easter Rising had not failed, the Home Rule of Ireland might not have been achieved. Also the tension between Ireland and Britain might have gotten worse. The example of Easter Rising shows that sometimes failure is more beneficial than success. Due to this exemplary of the history of Ireland I definitely concur with the statement “Sometimes failure is more beneficial than success.”',\n",

I not only play the game, but I also study deeply in a variety kinds of stats in Major League Baseball, and play \"Fantasy Baseball\", a game played with players\\' stats and records. To me, baseball is not just a game playing with a bat and a ball. It is the most scientific sports on the Earth. For example, There are more than hundreds stats in baseball in one player.

There are about 300 e-sports players, called progamers, and some of them earn more than 100,000 dollars. As E-Sports have great potentials, I often write a columns in a website.

For example, large factories cause a lot of pollution, which is harmful to humans and nature, and I do not want anything harmful in my community.\\r\\n\\tA large factory produces many fumes because large factories usually burn fuel to support factories’ energy needs. This process not only causes air pollution, but also makes many kinds of harmful elements to human, such as carbon monoxide. Also, a large factory consumes a lot of water to clean the factory and to dilute scum. This process makes the water very dirty. Unfortunately, this water is even more dangerous than polluted air from a large factory. When the factory releases this water into a river or lake, many organisms in the river or lake are going to die. In addition, these water sources might be filtered and used as tap water. As a result, building a factory in the community would not be good for environment and people’s health.\\r\\n\\tA large factory needs many trucks to move its products. This would cause a traffic jam near the factory. A number of large trucks may also damage roads due to their excessive weight. If road conditions gets bad, it is dangerous to drive because road is unevenly paved. Also, huge amount of traffic of these trucks is dangerous to other drivers because trucks are large, which means that there are areas where truck drivers cannot see. Large trucks also make noisy sounds. Therefore, a large factory in my community would be dangerous to people.\\r\\n\\tEven the effects that seem beneficial to the community may cause harmful effects. Since a large factory requires many people to work, it draws people to the community. Since more people will live in the community to work in the factory, the community is going to be more productive. However, a more highly populated community may bring higher crime rates, jeopardizing the community’s safety.\\r\\n\\tIn my opinion, despite a large factory’s benefits, the community’s safety is more important than the construction of a large factory. Also, large factories pollute the environment so much that it takes a long time for the environment to recover. I prefer living in a safe, non-polluted community, and that is the reason I oppose the building of the company’s large factory.',\n",

To stay healthy, I try to do some exercises at least an hour a day, and I try to balance my diet. The reason I do these is that both constant exercise and balanced diet are easy to control, but at the same time, they are very effective to stay healthy.\\r\\n\\tOne of the easiest exercises is walking and running. Since these exercises can be done in anyplace at anytime, they do not consume as much time as other exercises do. For example, to play golf, I need to carry golf clubs, and I also have to move to golf fields, which takes up a lot of time. These are the reasons I like walking and running as the best exercises. Walking is easy, but it keeps my legs strong and developed. This is important because people use their legs daily. Running is harder, but it consumes a lot of fats. Since too many fats in our body are not good, running is healthy to everyone including fat people. On weekends, when I have more time, I play tennis because it is more enjoyable than walking and running. Playing tennis also makes many parts of body to move. This is good because I get to use muscles that I normally wouldn’t.\\r\\n\\tThere is another thing I do to stay healthy. I try to avoid fast foods like hamburgers or french fries. Fast foods like these contain a lot of oil and fat. Oil has many cholesterols in it. This is not healthy to body because when cholesterols piles up inside of people’s body, they can block bloodstreams, which can cause heart attacks. Also, excessive fats in fast foods are going to make people fat because our body does not need that much fats, resulting our body to store remaining fats. This is another reason of heart attacks.\\r\\n\\tExercising daily makes our body to move muscles that normally wouldn’t move during our daily life. This prevents our body to get stiff. Exercising also burns fats that are harmful to human when there are plenty of them. Avoiding fast foods will reduce the amount of oils and fats we eat daily. Since exercising regularly and avoiding fast foods are easy for me, I do these to stay healthy.',\n",

It is not an easy task because there are several obstacles in front of us and we can't avoid them since they are on my way to the goal line.  In the other word, we have to face the obstacles and overcome them.  When you confront first few hurdles, you get scared and hesitate.  However, after then, you start getting a rhythm and easily overcome the next hurdles.  In real life, first few obstacles make you nervous and hesitate.  However, you have to overcome them eventually; some people will take a long time to get over them while others get over them easily.  Also, if you don't overcome the obstacles, then you can't reach the goal line.  Helen Keller and I are the great examples that used an obstacle as an oppotunity.\\r\\n  Helen Keller was born just like a normal kid.

However, one day while pumping a water, Helen finally realized what Sullivan tried to teach her.  After then, Helen tried to learn more stuff from her teacher.  She didn't think that she is a handicap, but one of the special kind.  She studied harder than any other students and later attended college with normal students.

Teenagers can easily gain knowledge, reduce their time and make diversity of friends from all over the world by surfing the internet.

In retrospect, I used to stay after school to ask something that I didn’t understand or drag myself to local library to find out something. This took away a lot of my time.

After exchanging e-mails we get to know each other better and become friends. Not only do I make friends from Homepage, but also from chatting. I made a friend in Beijing from chatting, during the APAC Volleyball tournament I was able to visit Beijing and meet her. In the teenagers point of view, surfing the net makes us more gregarious and we make are able to make new friends. \\r\\n\\r\\nDespite the disadvantages, surfing the net is beneficial to teenagers more than it is harmful.

       " (\"The relationship between gambling and crime is simple. Gambling is a kind of crime that seems like non-crime activity because it looks fancy. A good example is casinos. \\r\\n\\r\\nGambling is a crime, because the person who wins gets money that he didn't work for. The money he gets is something that is taken away from other people. In that sense gambling has a lot in common with theft. Theives take away money from other people who earned money. Theives don't work very hard to steal money.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe other reason is that gambling ruins people's minds, and often can lead to other crimes. For example, if someone loses money, he would try to win it back, and in the process he is likely to lose even more money. If the money he lost was a large amount, he would want it back badly. If the lost money was borrowed, he will have such a hard time trying to pay back the debt. The circle of borrowing money, losing it repeats it self until the debt is too huge to pay back. This could lead to theft or robbery, if that person who gambled is desperate. It could happen to any innocent person who, for a little while thought gambling is an okay game to play. The person who lost money and had debt could also commit suicide, because he cannot pay back the money or return to the social position that he used to be in. \\r\\n\\r\\nThose are the reasons why I think gambling is a crime. People who gamble, and casino owners are committing crimes. The gamblers do it by getting money they are not supposed to have. The casino owners do it by taking people's money away and making many people commit crime. The whole world should realize the fact.\",\n",

Romes victory against Carthage, the Tiananmen Square massacre, and Abraham Lincoln's presidency are all fine examples of how failure can sow the seeds of success.\\r\\n   Although Rome eventually defeated Carthage during the Poenic Wars, it did not do so well in the beginning. Although Rome had the superior army, it had to sail across the Mediterranean to attack Carthage. The Carthaginean navy, which was far superior to that of Rome, prevented the Roman transports from reaching Carthage. As a result, Rome lost many of its troops in the Mediterranean sea. However, the failure was initial. Rome learned from its defeats, and soon created a powerful navy that ultimately brought victory to Rome. Rome's naval failures eventually led to its birth as one of the most powerful empires in history.\\r\\n   The Chinese also reaped success from failure. During the Tiananmen Square massacre, thousands of college students held demonstrations against the communist party, demanding freedom and equality. The party responded with a brutal massacre, killing hundreds of young students. The demonstration itself was a failure. However, it was a pivotal moment in China's history. Soon after the tragedy people shunned the government for its brutality and demanded that they adhere to the wishes of these brave college students. As a result, China underwent a series of reforms, becoming a modernized and democratic superpower. The initial failure of the Tiananmen Square demonstrations sowed the seeds of China's prosperity.\\r\\n   Abraham Lincoln was another man whose failures led him to success. Before becoming one of America's most famous president, Abraham Lincoln had to endure a series of humiliating failures. He lost no less than six elections before finally becoming a mayor. Then, he endured two more humiliating defeats before finally entering the office. In his autobiography he says that his many defeats gave him the wisdom and strength he needed to lead the nation in the face of the Civil War. Abraham Lincoln's failures created a solid foundation for his glorious success.\\r\\n   There is a saying, 'Failure is the mother of success.' Rome's victory over Carthage, China's reforms, and Abraham Lincoln's presidency are all significant examples that show us how failures can make way for success. One shouldn't be discouraged from failures; they are only steps in his long road to success.\",\n",

Now with the improvement of technology, those things seem possible.  If there was none that even dreamed of it and wrote about it, nobody would\\'ve even tried to achieve it. \\r\\n\\r\\nAltogether, I think that we need to read fiction because it can broaden our perspective. There are things that we cannot get from reading only non-fiction. Those things can be gained by reading fiction.',\n",

According to a survey conducted on 10,000 Korean elementary school students, 90% of the children wanted to become important people with a considerable amount of society. Also, when asked further, the same percentage of students said they are willing to do anything to get their desired occupations.

We had no claws, no horns, no camouflage; we were an aberration in the animal kingdom. However, humans possessed a unique trait; the ability to gain and organize information.

       " ('Korean students are perhaps some of the most hard-working students in the world. They grow up in one of the world’s most competitive and challenging education systems. Many people therefore find it hard to believe that the scholastic ability of Korean students has lowered. Unfortunately, it is true; students are becoming more and more scholastically unable. ‘Scholastic ability’ doesn’t consist solely of memorizing facts and formulas. Creativity is just one of many other elements that determine a student’s scholastic capability. Many factors are responsible for the scholastic deterioration. The education system, the students’ lack of interest, and the dearth of adequate educational resources are just a few examples that block the path of Korean students.\\r\\n\\tTo diagnose the reason behind the academic deterioration, one must first examine the context that is contributing to this phenomenon. One good place to look would be the education system. Throughout their academic careers Korean students are shaped by the education system. This is where their academic values and abilities are formed. By looking at the system, one can examine the academic lives of Korean students.\\r\\n\\tThe Korean education system has one serious, fundamental flaw: it discourages creativity. Learning in the Korean system is hardly an interaction; teachers teach students, and students absorb what the teacher tells them. In fact, students do little in school but sit, listen, and take notes. Seldom do they ask teachers questions. The deep-rooted Confucianism in Korean society is partially to blame. Confucianism tells learners to respect their teachers and to never question their validity. Because of this cultural trend students are reluctant to ask teachers, and teachers in their turn are reluctant to take questions; it looks as if the student is challenging the teacher’s position. This rigid fixture discourages curiosity and academic pursuit beyond the material teachers teach students.\\r\\n\\tAnother cause of this critical flaw is that individuality is discouraged in the Korean education system. Often a strict line is set between right and wrong, and there exists only one answer to a question. Any other solution is frowned upon and challenged. Individual opinion is also treated in the same manner. Because the Korean education system expects students to act as a group, any uniqueness is viewed as a defect, an aberration. Again, cultural background plays a key role in creating this phenomenon. Collectivism was valued over individualism in the traditional Korean society, and that preference persists today in the education system. \\r\\n\\tIt must be noted that the fundamental flaws of the education system are not the sole reason contributing to the low scholastic ability of Korean students. Another gigantic factor is the inability of the system to accommodate pure scholastic pursuit in the first place. This rigidity exacerbates the deterioration, confining Korean students to scholastic incompetence. \\r\\nKorean education leaves little room for imagination, and as a result students find it hard to think beyond their assigned curriculum. This is a serious detriment to students’ studies. Not only does it limit the possibilities of further research, it also limits the very view students are able to hold. Without a comprehensive view of the world around them, students cannot find new areas where they can continue their pursuit of knowledge and understanding. A crucial part of scholastic ability is the ability to constantly pursue knowledge and seek understanding. Without a secure mind set upon which to start the pursuit, students are scholastically invalid.\\r\\nThe dearth of adequate educational resources is also a serious problem. Some Korean students do see beyond what the education system sets for them. However, once they set out to satisfy their academic curiosity they find that there just aren’t enough resources. Unfortunately for them, society’s supply of resources revolves strictly around the education system. One can observe this just by going to the nearest bookstore. Every study guide is centered on either GPA or the annual college entrance exams. There is no room for any sincere indulgence into the studies. It is therefore not a great surprise that students forget most of what they have studied for by the time they enter college. Some even venture to say that Korean education ends after 12th grade.\\r\\nPerhaps the most important factor that causes academic deterioration is the attitude of the students themselves. When asked, students answer that they don’t care much about scholastic pursuits. Although some responsibility lies with the flawed education system, it is amazing just to what extent students are indifferent about studying. The majority of the students aspire only for high-paying jobs such as doctors and lawyers. In college, they rarely apply for majors that involve rigorous studies. Indeed, the social trend shows all too well just how little value students put on scholastic achievement. Scholastic ability has fallen according with the indifference towards learning.\\r\\nKorean students’ scholastic ability has lowered. There is no doubt in that assertion. It is important that we analyze the reasons behind the problem and work to find a solution. The nature of the Korean education system and the social trend that is created around it are the two main contributors to our scholastic deterioration. Fortunately, Korea is already moving to address the problem. Teachers are trying more interactive teaching methods, and students are slowly becoming more and more diverse. It will not be long before the social trends also shift for the better. The scholastic deterioration of Korean students is not a permanent fixture; it is a problem that can be solved, and hopefully, it will be soon.',\n",

You could end up unable to understand things that the person said after the thing you couldn't understand. \\r\\n\\r\\nLearning by reading is also good because it takes less time than learning by doing things or listnening to other people.  Learning by reading takes much less effort when you want to start learning. When you want to learn about something, you can always take a book out of a shelf and start studying it, or you can look it up on the internet and read it. I'll take the example of studying about light. If you want to learn by listening, you should find someone who knows about light well or some videos of lectures. Even if you can do that easily, it takes time to listen and the person who is telling you about light can get tired. When you can't understand something, it takes more effort trying to rewind the video than flipping pages of reading materials. If you are trying to find out about light by doing something like an experiment or an observation and reasoning, it takes a lot of time and effort. \\r\\n\\r\\nThose are the reasons why I think learning by reading it best for me. Reading and learning about things is the easiest to reach, and takes less effort for me.\",\n",

       " (\"All the reasons why people live longer generally can be summarized into this; people are living in a better physical condition.  Better medication, sanitation, food, clothing and shelter made people live longer.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the industrial revolution, almost everything started to be produced in large amounts in a factory. People used to make clothes by themselves at home and it took a lot of time and effort to make one. Clothing is important because it keeps out the chill in the winter and protects the body from getting hurt. People who weaved clothes by themselves couldn't make a lot of clothing. Therefore people didn't have enough clothes. Some people even wore one piece of clothing all year long. It could be too hot in the summer and too cold in the winter. That is not good for their health. Nowadays clothing is cheap and easy to get. This improved people's living condition. \\r\\nFood is also producted in large amounts. Thus it is easier to get food than before. Agricultural technology developed much compared to the past. In the past, when they couldn't have enough food because of an environmental disaster, people starved to death. Nowadays there are much less people dying of hunger.\\r\\nHouses are needed to protect people from weather changes and other harsh conditions. In the present there are enough houses to house almost everyone. \\r\\n\\r\\nMedical researches helped find ways to cure a lot of diseases. People use to die of pneumonia when there was no penicillin. Now, people survive diseases that were incurable back then. This also helped making people live longer. \\r\\n\\r\\nImprovement in sanitation also helped. When people are in dirty places, they are more exposed to disease causing microbes. They are more likely to get sick. When the surrounding is clean, there is much less chance of getting sick. Clean environment helps prevent disease, which could be more important than curing disease.\\r\\n\\r\\nI think those improvements helped people live much longer than before. With the development of technology, I think human lives will be prolonged even more.\",\n",

However in my opinion, a zoo has disadvantages more than its advantage that it makes people happy.\\r\\n  First of all, animals confined in steel cages may be distressed mentally. Instinctively, animals are active in their own environment. Lions run to eat their prey such as antelopes and zebras in prairie and monkeys move from trees to trees in jungle. However zoo can't offer perfect environment to each animal same as its homelands. Thus animals can't satisfy their desires in zoos and therefore they can have anxiety in their minds.\\r\\n  Not only dissatisfaction of their desires but also man's behaviors can distress them. Confined in the steel cages everyday, animals have to hear yelling children and be pointed by fingers everyday. Although these actions seem so tiny to people who make them, these become a huge stress to animals.\\r\\n  Also, it is hard for animals to adjust to the climate which is different from their homelands. Animals have developed to adjust to their own regions and climates. For instance, physically, polar bears are apt to live in polar cold region and monkeys are apt to live in hot jungle. However in our region where four seasons are distinct, animals from polar or tropical regions are hard to survive. Thus, different climates also can irritate animals from other regions.\\r\\n  Zoo can cause harmful influence to man as well as to animals. Because of excrements from animals, people living near the zoo have to smell bad odor everyday. Also, if a zoo is in a city, the streets around the zoo will be jammed by a lot of cars on every weekends.\\r\\n  In conclusion, a zoo has not useful. Although people can enjoy from a zoo, animals confined in cages can be distressed. Instinctively, animals want to run and catch its prey by themselves and eat what they want. Now it is time to respect animals as members that compose the Earth together with us and see zoo in the viewpoint of a lot of them confined in cages.\",\n",

However, it has a lot of side effects such as polluting the environment and causing psychological emptiness.\\r\\n\\r\\nEnvironmental pollution is a huge side effect that technology caused. With the technological advance, factories are able to produce a lot of things that make humans live convenient, such as cars, televisions, washing machines etc. However, the factories that manufacture such things do not care much about the environment when making those products, because they have to spend more money if they try toprotect the environment. The products themselves are polluting the environment. A good example is cars. Exaust gas that cars send out  is the main cause of air pollution.\\r\\n\\r\\nPsychological emptiness is not somethign that makes the world a better place to live. Nowadays people are busy, and technological advance has made people live more conveniently without many social contacts. In older days, people used to have more social connections.  For example, in those days that farmers didn't have the machines that helps doing farm work, neighbors used to help eachother out and become a community . The people in the community had more sense of being included and important, friendship and love. Farmers nowadays don't have those communities. When people lack  feeling of connection with others, people start feeling empty inside. Some people even commit suicide to escape the emptiness. \\r\\n\\r\\nUntil now, technology has made some progress in making the world a better place to live, but it has taken more steps backward. Technology does have the power to make the world a better place to live. However, right now we have to try harder to use technology in a better direction.\",\n",

I think those movies are better than the movies that are designed only to amuse and entertain. \\r\\n\\r\\nEntertaining movies are good for relaxing. They don't make you think. You just watch it and laugh when other people laugh. However, after watching a movie that is only entertaining, you feel rather hollow. The hour you watched the movie seems like  a waste of time, and the money you spent on the movie seems wasted. Movies designed to entertain only are more likely to be out of common sense than the movies that make the audience think. That is the reason why  you sometimes feel strangely hollow after watching movies that are only entertaining. This is one of the reasons why I prefer watching movies that makes people think.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother important reason I prefer watching movies that make people think is that movies affect people so much. Entertaining movies could go in a extreme way only to entertain people. There are even movies that makes people think killing is cool and entertaining. For example, there is a movie that came out recently that tells about a married couple that are assassins. They kill so many people in the movie. The audience who are watching the movie enjoy it without thinking, because the actor and the actress are good looking people and the movie is telling the story in those killer's point of view. I have seen many friends that think the killers in the movie are cool. I have tried to pursuade those kids to think how cruel it is to kill. They don't listen. They just think those killers are cool. You can easily see in this example how much a movie could affect people. I'd rather watch a movie that affects me in a possitive way. \\r\\n\\r\\nThose are the reasons why I think the movies that make you think is better than the ones that are only entertaining. I think the movies that are only entertaining waste of time and money, and some of those movies could affect my mind in a negative way. That is enough to make one think the way I think.\",\n",

Due to this reason, I started to enjoy reading history books and I'd like to study it more professionally if I have opportunity. \\r\\n  Also, nowadays studying world history became important since the world is getting closer and smaller.

The best way to understand their lives is to know their histories. For they have developed with their histories, their lives are impressed in them. For example, we can find that Chinese usually think that they are in the best in the world because of their long history that they had dominated a lot of countries in the past.

It can decline student's efficiency. The overheated competition among teacher will make the academic atmosphere tainted with greed.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is not important how much student have learned, but it is important how hard student study.

However, being allowed to do something doesn't necessarily mean that it is accepted widely in a society. For example, many people scowl at men who want to become a baby sitter. They say things like 'That job is something that would be apt for a girl. That's so girly. Be a man.'  Many people expect men to be manly and women to be ladylike. That means we still have a double standard.\\r\\n\\r\\nGuess what happened in this story. There was a father and a boy who were riding in a car, and there was a car accident.

Maybe you could look for a place to sleep and find the way to a station, but you miss all the fun of a trip by looking those things up. If you don't find those things on a computer, you will certainly ask someone there to guide you. You will learn their customs and their culture. I think learning that is a good experience. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhen you take a diary with you, you can store your memories in the diary. Your written feelings about the places you visited makes you feel like you're in the place once again when you read your diary. I once went on a trip to Europe and wrote a little bit on a diary, and when I look at those writings I feel happy and I also regret why I hadn't written more things on it.  You can also write about places you would like to visit again or some things that you needed on a trip, to prepare for your next trip. I find it relaxing to write in a diary, so that's another reason why  I would take a diary on a trip. A diary is also very light, therefore it is appropriate for a trip.\\r\\n\\r\\nTaking a diary on a long trip is really nice. You can recall the feelings that you felt on your trip, and it doesn't take much fun away from you. It just doubles the joy of a trip. That's the reason why I would take a diary with me than anything else.\",\n",

This is a normal phenomenon. On the top of the food pyramid chain, we humans are mightier than any other organism. In order for us to survive we must intake meat, vegetable and other substances.  Not only does this make it our nature to eat meat but also numerous advantages can be gained from in taking meat. Looking at these reasons I believe it is human nature to eat meat. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSome prefer being vegetarians, others advocate eating meat will raise their cholesterol level. However eating excessive amount of vegetables can weaken the body. On the other hand, seldom consumption of meat is necessary to humans. In taking meat is beneficial to the growth of humans. Meat is especially necessary to teenagers. It will help the growth of youngsters and provide nutrition.  In House Management class, our teacher taught us that eating meat as a child will bring the result of becoming a fit and healthy adult in the future. Believe it or not, my mother keeps telling me the reason that I am tall and healthy is due to the meat she fed me as I was young.  \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMoreover, by the consumption of meat, we can gain enormous nutrition. As a healthy and beneficial component, meat is a major energy source to humans. It has been proven by scientists that meat itself is not a risk factor for diseases such as cardiovascular disease. Amazingly, meat can actually lower plasma cholesterol, contribute significantly to tissue omega-3 fatty acid and provide a good source of iron, zinc, and vitamin B12. \\r\\n\\r\\nJust like the rules of the animal kingdom, we humans eat other organisms to sustain our life. Eating too much meat will bring harm to us, however seldom consumption is beneficial to us. Meat has been known to help the development of youngster in a healthy and efficient way. More over, meat will help our body fight diseases; it will lower plasma cholesterol and provide good sources. It has been stated that the amount of meat consummated is increasing every year. By looking at these factors, I believe that it is human nature to eat meat.',\n",

Both of them have advantages. \\r\\n\\r\\nFirst, trying a new things makes us learn a lot about the world around me. If someone emigrate to other country, he has to go through a lot of changes. In the way of adjusting, he experiences trial and error. From our mistake we can learn a great deal and in the end we woll benefit greatly from what we learn. Moreover,if we go through a lot of changes, we can break our own limit and stereotype. I have been Canada for fifteen days before, and I had to experience a lot of change, from food to manner. The customs,foods and ideas are totally different from our country.\\r\\nThrough that trip, I can realize there are many people who have totally different idea of me, and I can break my stereotype;in manners, customs or personalities. Since I can think in many directions, I could be more creative. \\r\\n\\r\\nSecond, livign without change does not mean that we lead a boring life, because the life can be more fulfilling. In my friend's case, my friend choose more stable way and acheive her goal.  At first, my friend wanted to go foreign language school and she studied English very hard, but one year after, her mind went through a little change and she started to consider go to science shool.If she were want to go science shool, she would have to give all the things that she had been studying and have to adapt to totally new things.  She thought going foreign language shool is more stable and choose that way. Therefore, now she is a foreign language shool student and she received a scholarship. Likewise, without a lot of change we can achieve goals on a continual basis.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome afraids the changes and some wants to get through changes. Without change we can get stabilities, and with a lot of changes we can learn more about the world. Both of them are good, but I think the latter is wiser way to lead one's life. Since it gives us a lot of mistakes, so through that mistakes, we can look back on.\",\n",

At first when I saw this topic, I thought it would be nice to live in a small and peaceful town. However after thinking for a while, I decided to live in a big city because it is more worthier than living in a small town.\\r\\n  First of all, I like big cities for I can enjoy my life. Most of the concerts and festivals are held and most of the sport teams have their home stadiums in big cities. Thus if I live in a big city, I can enjoy these things whenever the game is held. Also I can meet lots of people at diverse fields in a big city. This is another excitement to understand others who have different interests and live in different ways from me.\\r\\n  Moreover, it is better to grow in a big city than in a small town because of better educational environment. There are more higher educational institutions such as research institutions and universities and cultural institutions such as museums, galleries and theaters in big cities. Thus in a big city, children and students can not only study a lot of things what they want from diverse educational institutions but also cultivate their cultural spirits from watching lots of performances. However it is rare to have these experiences in a small town.\\r\\n  Some people say that transportation problem is the worst thing in a big city. However, in my opinion, it isn't a problem if we use public transportations efficiently. Big cities have more developed transportation system such as subways and buses than small towns have. So if we use these effectively, we need not to pay expensive parking fee and waste our time in heavy traffic jams. However in a small town, we need to ride cars whenever we fo out because there are few public transportation and it is far to go other places. So we have to pay lots of money to buy gasolines. Therefore I think transportation in a big city isn't a problem.\\r\\n  It is true that a big city has more pollution than a small town. However, we can be healthy if we exercise in gyms or parks everyday. Also it is true that there are more crimes and incidents in a big city. However we should consider that there are more police officers, fire fighters and doctors who will help us whenever a problem occurs.\\r\\n  In conclusion, I prefer to live in a city. I can't imagine living without delicious restaurants, nice concerts and exciting movies that makes me satisfied. Also, I don't want to know only few restricted people in a small town. I want to understand how those who are different from me think and how they live in a big city.\",\n",

People who offered higher education can think they are special and selected person. In Korea, most of people take university education., but some people are not because of their poor home environment. There are many discrimination in company between who is educated in university and who is not.

To take pictures and recollect the past days in the future, I think a digital camera is the best choice if I should take only one thing in addition to clothing and personal items.\\r\\n  When we go a trip to somewhere, the landscapes which are different from our hometowns and famous places in there attract us. Watching beautiful sights, we take pleasures from them and naturally want to take pictures of ourselves with them. We can be satisfied by taking pictures and watching pictures during our trips.\\r\\n  Also, when we see these pictures in the future, we can recollect the past vividly just as watching pictures of myself when I was a baby. Watching pictures of ourselves in the past, we can enjoy ourselves and look back what I have done and how I grew. In the same way, from watching pictures of our trips, we can feel similar to what we felt in those days and remember those days lively.\\r\\n  Moreover, it is convenient to show pictures to others when we use digital cameras. We can connect digital cameras with computers and save pictures in computers. Thus, we can send pictures to others or upload pictures to our mini-homepages easily through Internet whenever we want. If we want to send pictures to our families and friends to show them how we are living and what we saw during the trips, digital cameras are very needed to us. When I came back from Europe, I uploaded my pictures taken during the trip to my mini-homepage. So that I can show my friends how I stayed and what I saw during it easily and vividly.

       " (\"Between the choices between science, and humanities and art, I personally believe that choosing science has more merits. My preference is based on being more useful and leaving tangible outcomes. Art and humanities, in general, have not actually changed the life style over the centuries, while development in science has brought a direct change in life, usually inventing new devices and other authomated machines that improve the quality of life; computers, TVs, and telephones are all the products of the past investment in science. In that sense, for the betterment of the quality of life, I think the science should be promoted.\\r\\n\\r\\nArt and humanities give people a spiritual satisfaction, but the products of their studies are unpredictable and mostly unreliable. Studying philosophy and drawing pictures may cheer up someone's feelings, but they don't necessarily give tangible results to improve one's life. However, investing in science is more promising because studies of science usually yield an output proportion to the input. While art may be pursued and studied without much money, science today requires many equipments that cost astronomical amount of money; also there may exist a hungry artst but hardly a hungry scienctist. Why not then, invest in science which ensures outcomes and needs money more desperately than the arts and humanities?\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother aspect of science is that students avoid the subject because the textbooks are tedious. To make science more interesting, lab experiments are essential part of the lecture, as a former nobel-prize-winner, Mr Feignmen mentioned. To learn science, one needs to experiment and see how those laws and principles can be related to the real world. Textbooks can be the perfect guide to set up an experiement, but conducting the experiment requires experience, efforts, and most importantly, money.\\r\\n\\r\\nRealizing the importance of science, people do make donations to the science research teams, and they are rewarded with the new technological devlopments that can cure diseases and improve communication devices. In order to continue such development in the field of science, students from high school should be supported with enough equipments and financial supports to encourage them. After all, one-million-dollar investment today may make a next Eistein that could change the history of mankind by making miraculous contributions.\",\n",

Not realizing the reality of the shows, the gullible and unwise people fall for the false presentation of the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe justification of the Iraq War had been announced as keeping the democracy intact around the world.

Although mass media have the responsibility to provide the stories from both sides, Jewish and Palestinians, Jewish stories are told more often and sometimes even with a kind sympathy from the announcers or editors.

However, I have to say that no reason is good enough for killing hundreds and thousands of people. For example, there are the Crusades who went to fight for their religion. When the pope gave a speech saying that they need to fight  to get Jerusalem back, people thought it was a great thing to do. They thought it was a justice that needs to be done. When the army started to fight,  many people were killed, lots of children were driven to war, women were raped. The reason for this war was not enough to compensate for the enormous damage it caused.  The most important thing in this world are people's lives.

People who live in a country that is having a war have to go and fight whether they like it or not. They are forced to kill. People are often killed or injured in a war. The people who are injured often have serious injuries. Some people can't even move for the rest of their lives.  However, wars not only cause  the injuries in bodies but also injuries in mind.The guilt people feel after a war is enormous. After a war people see a whole country devasted. Children who are born only around 4 or 5 lie dead in the battle field. Even the people who thought they were fighting for the right thing look at those things and start thinking again. Most people end up thinking it was a horrible thing that they did. They cannot free themselves from the guilt for the rest of their lives. The families who have a member who is dead from a war feel terrible sadness. \\r\\n\\r\\nAltogether, a war causes so much pain for all the people who are engaged in a war. We must question ourselves before even thinking about starting a war. What do people get after a war if they win? Maybe more land and natural resources, maybe more power over other nations.

In fact, ignorant people were easier to govern until they learned to make tools and fight against the ruler\\'s army.

       " (\"Both of agriculture and business are important to people living this time. So at first, it was hard to choose for recommending only one research center between these two. However, at last I decided to recommend a center for research in agriculture for my country.\\r\\n   First of all, a research center for agriculture can be benefits to everyone in the country. While business can only make benefits for certain people who have jobs or interests in business field, agriculture can be benefits to not only farmers but also everyone in the world. For example, if the agricultural research center invents a kind of crop that can survive in the strong winds, it can help not only farmers whose means of living are these crops but also people who can buy them in a normal price in the harvesting season because there will be no impact on amount of them after the big typhoons.\\r\\n  Moreover, I want to solve a social problem that farmers are giving up their farmings and leaving their hometowns. Koreans has lived on rice from the past. However, because of influence of western food, Koreans' taste changed nowadays. Thus, the consumption of rice has reduced continuously and farmers are now having trouble in making their money with only rice farming. If a research center for agriculture analyze and predict the change in people's taste and give advices to farmers, there will be no trouble for farmers to understand the trend of food and change of tastes and earn their money easily. Then, the problem that farmers give up their works and go to the city will be disappeared.\\r\\n  There are more physical hardships to farmer than businessman. Because farmers have to work difficultly with their bodies, they have many sicknesses. According to a research, there are a lot of aged farmers living with their painful sicknesses nowadays. To reduce these aching people, I think a research center for agriculture is needed for inventing new machines and systems for farmers to let them work conveniently.\\r\\n  For these reasons, I would like to recommend a research center for farming in my country. Eating has been the most basic and significant part for living and so the farming has been the most important thing to people from a long time ago. While other industries will be changing and changing everyday in the future, I certainly think that farming will always be remaining the most important industry to human.\",\n",

Such misunderstanding came from some erudite scholars’ reference to them while some of the old stories do not fit into the today’s world. Although one may benefit from the myths dealing with the fundamental facts of life, some of the myths are no longer in effect and outdated.\\r\\n\\r\\n     A great example comes from the Greek Mythology that tells the story of “Echo.” Echo is a beautiful elf in a forest who admires Narcissus. However, chasing after the Echo’s beautiful features, Zeus involves himself in adultery. Enraged with her husband’s actions, Hera, takes her revenge to Echo and makes a incapable of speaking at her will. Since then, Echo can only repeat after what others’ say, and her miserable fate leads to her death longing for her love, Narcissus.\\r\\n\\r\\n     The anecdote above contains some logical flaws and harshly biased judgments that need corrections. First of all, Hera’s curse on Echo is one of the illogical elements in the story. From the incident, people often conclude that someone in higher power can be justified for her misconducts, or even be forgiven. However, the idea is danger, for equality is what the U.S. and the rest of the world today is build on. Also, Echo’s death shows lack of concern for one’s life while life today represents more than anything. Her death over her love therefore should not be considered a beautiful one, but rather a pathetic one.\\r\\n\\r\\n     Although the story itself does not explicitly tells people what to think, it gives insinuations that are mostly the false images of life. While most of the myths carry morals and lessons, a few inconspicuous exceptions do exist to put people’s judgment in jeopardy. In that sense, the old myths often do handicap peoples’ clear understanding of society and life by giving wrong ideas with obsolete stories.',\n",

In my opinion, help from animals is a reward for Cinderella for being kind to the animals.\\r\\n\\tEven though Cinderella lived in a very harsh environment, she was usually happy. This was the reason that Cinderella was able to endure all of those hardships. When she was depressed about harsh treatments from her step-mother and sisters, she thought of happy moments like the time she danced with the prince. These happy thoughts soon made Cinderella feel better, and she was able to continue working the next day with happy mood. This is a very important lesson because Cinderella showed that thinking happy makes her happy. If I encounter such a harsh situation, I would never think of happiness, and get depressed until I overcome the situation.\\r\\n\\tIn my opinion, these lessons, overcoming a difficult situation and thinking positively, are essential in our lives. Thus, I like the story of Cinderella the best because it motivates and teaches me the ways to endure and overcome hardships.',\n",

       " ('I believe that success in workplace is determined by the ability to work with others. For example, Apollo space programs succeeded because there was a good team work among people. People in space followed the commands of the people on earth, and people on earth worked very hard to ensure that the astronomers are safe. There was cooperation behind success. People must work together in order to succeed. This is clearly shown in the works that require many people. These works include filming a movie, writing a program, and working in a chemistry lab.\\r\\n\\tFilming a movie is a great example that shows how people work together. In order to make a successful movie, everyone involved in making the movie must work together, including directors, actors, cameramen, etc. For example, directors must encourage and give suggestions to actors and cameramen to make good movies. Directors also have to inspire team spirit so that other people involved in making movie can cooperate. Simply saying, directors must lead the group. Actors have to work together with other actors to make a good movie. When actors cooperate well, they would create realistic scenes. However, if actors do not work together, then no matter how well each individual actors act, whole movie will be awkward. Cameramen must inspire team spirit because they may not catch everything into the camera, and they may make some technical mistakes, which would mean that the actors must act again. If cameramen do not inspire team spirit, actors might be exhausted from trivial mistakes and actors may no longer follow directions from cameramen. Such a situation actually happened in filming a drama when a cameraman accidentally forgot to press “record” button. Thus, the ability of working together, leading and motivating others, and inspiring team spirit really are the ways to make a movie successful.\\r\\n\\tWhen I was in the computer programming class in my school, I noticed that writing computer program also requires team work. In the class, my classmates and I made a program that can convert either one of Celsius, Fahrenheit, or Kelvin to one another. This was a very simple program, but there were many disagreements on how to create the program because one of the classmates knew a lot about computer programming and insisted the rest of us to follow his way. When these disagreements got severe, someone stopped working, making all other students unable to work. As a result, the group of six students separated into two groups of two and four. This separation subsided the dispute, but neither group was able to make a robust program. I also worked in many chemistry labs in school, and I noticed that the cooperation between my partner and me is essential to the success of our experiments. When I tried to work by myself, results were not so great because I had to do all the work by myself in the same time. This caused me to make many trivial mistakes. However, when I cooperated well with my partner, we usually got good results because we had enough time to think about experiments and prepare exact amount of chemicals. In addition, we divided work so that each of us has less amount of work to do in the same time. This reduced mistakes significantly because we had enough time to check and correct mistakes. Cooperation does play a significant role in the success.\\r\\n\\tAs I mentioned above, the ability to work with others is very important. No matter how intelligent a person may be, without any cooperation, the person is less likely to succeed. I experienced it, and it happens everyday in our lives. Success in work place actually is depended on ability to work together, not in one’s intelligence.',\n",

However, our events always confront with unexpected incidents. The two protagonists of literature substantiated this opinion.\\r\\n     A person who plans carefully but suffer from an accidental event is well represented in Scott Fitzerald's novel The great Getsby. The main chracter, Getsby, makes a plan to be an enormous rich man to make his ex-love Daisy return to him. Even though he has been tired from the war, he endeavors for gathering money. His plan is effective, and he successes to meet Daisy again. Even they spend time together though she has an engaged man. One day, they has a date in Getsby's car while Daisy drives it. During their sweet conversation, Daisy bit a woman accidently. They are embarressed but run away from that place. Getsby seems to success of his plan and re-get his love. However, a husband of the dead woman fnds out Getsby's car and kills him to revenge. \\r\\n     Like Getsby, the main character of Theodore Dreiser's novel An American Tragedy also shows us a tragic person who undergoes unexpected suffering though plans carefully. Clyde who really abhors his poor environment and wants to belong in novel class leaves his home and starts to work in the big city. He reall y works hard to achieve his desire. He does not want anything except money. This ambition makes him to abandon his poor love, Roberta. However, he confesses him about having a baby and tells him that she cannot deal with this burdensome situation alone. Clyde thinks that Roberta is an big obstacle to achieve love with a rich girl Sondra and decides to kill Roberta, He plans carefully and considers every situation he will confront after murder. He pretends to want to spend time with Roberta on a boat then pushes her in a pond. Roberta dies immediately and Clyde runs away, He thinks that he can avoid any punishment. However, the police proves him as a muderer by detecting his traces and other people's statements. After all, Clyde also is sentendced death and becomes a tragic person.\\r\\n     Throughout the two characters, we can confirm that even careful plans have unexpected results. There are no perfect situation which can only helpful to us.\",\n",

However, would we feel the griefs if there were no other sources affecting us? It is really hard to control our own feelings, especially when we experience something unexpectedly tragic. Although I was always pretty confident that I could control my feelings in front of other people with my high self-esteem, I learned that I could break down from one experienceI had during my high school years. And so do other people, like my best friend who had to go through a tough time. \\r\\n     I am very fortunate because I haven't  experienced any deaths of people close to me.

My best friend, her family, and I went to watch a movie about a month before I heard the news, and I remembered her mother who looked healthy and fine. Then, I started to think about how my friend would have felt when she heard the news. It must have been tragic. My friend was in a great slump during that time although she knew she had to concentrate on studying. The greatest griefs were caused by the death of her mother, not from herself.\\r\\n     I once cried in front of other students in my class after I had a fight with other band members. I broke down because of mixed feelings. I was confused, sad, ashamed, and angry. And I was still sure that I had done nothing wrong and there was a misunderstanding. The grief I felt was caused by other people, not because of me.\\r\\n     Although we are the ones who feel the griefs and our brains are responsible for causing us to feel the griefs, it is mostly other factors that  cause our brains to send mournful signals. Sometimes, we experience things we didn't expect and it can be very shocking. It is hard for us to control our feelings when faced with tragic events and be optimistic. That's why I believe it is mostly an outside factor that cause the greatest griefs.\",\n",

Often innovation is driven by our attempt to adapt to a changing world. The invention of the locomotive and the invention of the lightbulb are both good examples of how innovation brought about great inventions and enabled us to adapt to a changing world.\\r\\nAs the Industrial Age began, the world underwent an inmutable change. Before then, people produced only enough to support themselves. However, as machines were invented and large factories built, huge quantities of products were being produced. The world needed a fast means of transportation to deliver resources and products to where they were desired. It was in this age that the locomotive was invented. Stevenson created the steam engine, enabling resources to be delivered to factories with  greatly-needed quickness. Stevenson's attempt to adapt to a changing world drove his innovation.\\r\\nAnother famous invention of approximately the same era is the lightbulb. At the time factories found it hard to meet their production quota because they could'nt run their machines at night. Candlelights solved this problem to some degree, but also made the wooden buildings vulnerable to fire. Thomas Edison's invention of the lightbulb was a well-timed event. The lightbulb brought light to dark factories at night without the dangers of a fire. The need to adapt to a new world of mass production spurred Edison's innovation and created one of our modern day necessities.\\r\\nThe world is a constantly changing place. Innovation is driven by our attempt to keep up with this fast pace. Stevenson's locomotive and Edison's lightbulb are only two of many products of innovation. As long as the world exists, there will be changes, and there also will be our innovation.\",\n",

The fastest way was via a horseriding mail carrier, and even that toook at least a week. Bell wanted to change this. Improving an invention he originall intended to aid the deaf, Bell created the first telephone.

They felt their conservative communist government was oppressing their freedom. They gathered at the Tiananmen Square and rallied against the State. The State tried to suppress this uprising with violence, but soon yielded. Chian underwent a series of reforms, changing from a strictly run prison into a more liberal capitalist superpower. The passion of the Chinese teers to bring about change resulted in a strong China.\\r\\nBell's invention of the telephone and the Tiananmen Square Massacre are just two of many events where great passion to bring about change resulted in a reshaping of our world.

       " (\"A scientific problem that I would like to solve now is the problem of achieving the nuclei fusion process. It is a problem that many scientists have worked on for years. If you use nuclei fusion process instead of nuclei division process in generating electricity, it is much safer. That is the reason why I want to solve the problem.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe world is using fossil fuel nowadays. Fossil fuel is made from dead plants compressed under layers of earth. Therefore it is finite. We will run out of the fuel someday. Also the need of fuel is greater than before. We have more factories that need power, more people who need electricity. This means we would use oil quicker than we did before. The need of another sorce of  energy for generating electricity is great. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn search of such sorce of energy, people found out windmills, dams, solar energy, generating energy from tides, and nuclei division process. People have tried generating electricity with dams. However, dams cannot generate much energy at once and we can't build enough dams to get enough electricity for everyone. Same goes for many other sorces. Also in some places, they do not have enough wind, sun light or tides. However, the nuclei division process is very useful in generating a lot of energy. The only defect is that it has a high rick of danger. You can easily see the problem in Chernobyl.\\r\\n\\r\\nNuclei fusion process generates energy according to the same principle as the nuclei division process; the principle of relativity. Einstein's famous E=mc^2 states that mass is a form of energy that is condensed. C means the speed of light, and m means the mass of an object. E means the energy or the object. The speed of light is about 300000000m/s. You can easily see that even and object with small mass can generate a lot of energy because energy equals mass times c squared. Nuclei fusion process does not let out radiation because it uses heavy hydrogen, therefore making it much safer than nuclei division process. An accident from  the fusion process in a power plant will not cause any more damage than a furniture factory can cause. However, using nuclei fusion processin a power plant is impossible right now. It needs a lot of heat when you start the process. A power plant using the fusion process would help the world greatly neverthless.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe process will rid the world of the worry and fight over oil. The process will not harm the environment, unlike the fossil fuel polluting by burning oil or harmimg the environment with radiation by the nuclei division process.

However, I think that the right to privacy is more important to people than catching criminals more efficiently. \\r\\n\\r\\nMany people want to be alone sometimes. Sometimes people feel that they should talk with someone privately. People need privacy in many situations. If the government is watching everyone in the country to thwart criminals, those people who want to be alone won't be able to do that. Even if there's no one in a room other than you, someone is still watching you. Even gossipping with your friends is not private. Everything is recorded and watched over. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe power to watch over everything is likely to be abused. Let's say that one country started using cameras to watch over all the people in the country to catch criminals. The system could work out well at first. All the criminals will be caught under the camera. However, if anyone in the office start using the cameras to be a supreme ruler of a nation, the person can easily become one. The person can put people who are against them to prisons. Those who remain out of prison cannot rebel because if they even tried to talk about it, the ruler can put them to prisons also. This situation is very well shown in the book 1984 written by George Orwell. The book describes a nation that is watched over throughly by things called 'telescreens', which is very similar to the cameras I mentioned above.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery person needs privacy, and if the privacy is taken from everyone, the one who has the power to watch over them can abuse the power. Therefore, I think the right to privacy is too important to be sacrificed to thwart criminals.\",\n",

However, a person who only experienced success may become too arrogant and even have a hard time acceptingthe reality when he or she does fail. People can learn a lesson and become a better person through failure.  \\r\\n     I read a book about a week ago written by Japanese. In that book, the author mentioned his friend who once was a very succesful business man. Because of all the money and fame he earned, he became too arrogant and didn't prepare for the worst. However, his company went broke and he was left with a big debt. He didn't try to face the reality, but kept on hiding, and his wife and daughter left him in the end. Through the story of his friend, the author tries to remind readers that too much success can be harmful to a person who never really experienced a big failure.\\r\\nUnlike the author's friend I mentioned above, president Lincoln had experienced many failures, but never gave up his dream. He faced failure in business when he was 31, and again when he was 34. He lost his election in the Congress. He lost the election for a member of the House of Representatives three times. He again failed to become a member of the Upper House. He finally became the sixteenth president of the United States when he was 60. He didn't give up after serious of failures, and changed the history of the world. He announced the emancipation of the slaves in 1863 and is still known as one of the respected presidents of all time. Some people might not overcome their past and give up.

Without any punishment and rule, they have freedom to do anything they want because this society is different from the old one which they were belonged. When they acknowledge this reality, thier instinct behaviors cannot be controlled any more.\\r\\n     Like the young children, the main character of The Catcher in the Rye also represents a person who suffers from the rules of society.

       " (\"Many scholars have said that 'the more we learn about other people, the more we learn about ourselves.' There are many reasons to support this opinion. One is the fact that we learn history. Also, there are other reasons such as the fact that we read books to study, and the fact that in everyday lives people admit to themselves that they learn about themselves by learning about other people.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery country teaches history to students. The reason they teach history is simplified in this statement, 'the more we learn about other people, the more we learn about ourselves.' In this case, 'other people' mean their ancestors. History repeats itself. To get out of a cycle that caused much harm before, we need to learn history. An example of such harm caused and repeated can be found in Korea. Koreans allowed Japanese to rule Japanese in Korea with Japanese law. If a Japanese mudered a Korean in Korea, Japanese judges judge the criminal. In this case the judge can be more generous to their own people. After the Lee Dynasty ended and the Republic was founded, Koreans made a mistake of allowing American armies to do the exact same thing as the Japanese did before. The result of it is this; two American soldiers killing two Korean girls in what they call 'an accident' and being  declared innocent without paying any fine or living a day in jail. Had the descendants recalled what happened with Japanese, nothing of the sort would have happened.  The descendants should have learned about what others did long ago to prevent the affair. This example shows that by learning about others, we learn the state we're in and about ourselves.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy reading books, we learn about other people. Whether the book is fiction or non-fiction, people learn from books. Books are written by many hands of other people. Therefore, by reading books we learn about other people's opinions. If someone reads a book, the person can see what others did or thought in some situations and broaden the knowldge from the book to their daily lives, finally learning about themselves. In the book 'The stranger', the author talks about a person who kills someone just because the sunlight was too strong and hot. The person in the book tells people how human minds could work in some situations.  We learn about ourselves by reading and knowing about others. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn our daily lives, we face many people. Some people have charicteristics that are offensive. Some have good charicteristics. We can learn about ourselves by learning about others.  Let's say there was a person who used to offend others by saying words without thinking. The person might not know what he did could do to others. However, by learning about someone else who had the same habbit, the person could learn how it would have felt when the person said to others. The person can learn about himself by learning about someone else. There is a saying 'Rocks in other mountains' in China. It can be translated into this: we can learn even by other people's wrongdoings. \\r\\n\\r\\nThose were the reasons why I thought that ' the more we learn about other people, the more we learn abou ourselves.' is true.The principle is simple, and we use it and study it in our daily lives.\",\n",

I would say that that price would be countless moments of failure. Experiences of failure are essential to walk the road to success, and many famous people in history have showed us this lesson. \\r\\n\\r\\n     Thomas Edison, the man who invented the light bulb, one said that before he finished the perfect light bulb, he failed 10,000 times. It is, then, these ten thousand times of trial-and-error that lead Edison to his fame and success. Everytime he failed to make his light bulb, it did not mean that he got nothing our of that trial; he learned someting from it and elimnated possibilities that would not work. It was through these ten thousand times that Edison learned additional knowledge about his invention and lead him to success.\\r\\n\\r\\n     When I was doing my biology experiment on the fish medaka, I had a similar experience, too. It was only after a one-year period of trial-and-error that I finished my reseasrch paper on the topic. The computer program my partner and I made had many faults in the beginning. Every contest we entered turned us down. However, after many times of failure and trying, we kept on improving the program and finally, our research paper got accepted into an international conference and won many awards. It was only later that I realized the failures I experienced gave me deeper knowledge of the topic and were the basic foundation my success was laid on. \\r\\n\\r\\n     The great Korean General Lee also is a perfect example for this quote. Before he was promoted as a superior general in the country, his life was full of failure, poverty, and bad luck. His leg was hurt in horseback-riding practice and thus, Lee could not even take the test that all men had to become a soldier. Nevertheless, he practiced very hard, and finally, Lee was accepted by the king as a general of the navy. Also, when Lee was inventing his new ship, Ku-buk-Sun, to defend Korea against Japan, he also experienced many times of failure before completing the perfect ship that actually played a major role in fighting against Japan.\\r\\n     \\r\\n     As we see in the lives of Edison, General Lee, and even in me, success is not only achieved by intuition alone; it is achieved by hard work and many experiences of failure. These times of trial-and-error are the basic foundation that success lays its foot on. Thus, failure does sow the seeds of success.',\n",

If we see the similar temperature pattern in the present, we can presume that we might go through the period of ice age. Learning about the past may help settling big problems between nations.

One moment in my people’s history succumbed to such passion.\\r\\n\\tDuring the 18th century, many European countries were expanding into Asia, bringing with them superior technology. Numerous Asian nations, including China, Japan, and India forfeited their sovereignty for the sake of modernization. However, Korea was different. The king feared that modernization would cause the people to overthrow the longstanding monarchy. To prevent this he ordered brutal persecution against anyone attempting to study western culture. Although this caused Korea to lag behind other Asian countries in the long run, the passion to keep the status quo prevented us from losing our sovereignty.\\r\\n\\tOn a more personal but related note, I also faced the passion to keep things as they were. Last year, our school was debating on whether we should keep wearing our uniforms. Many students felt that the dress code was restricting their rights to express themselves. To their surprise, the majority of the students wanted to keep using the uniforms. They felt that the school uniform looked tidy and rid them of their worries about what to wear to school. As a result, we are still using our school uniform. The passion to keep things as they are prevailed and preserved our school’s dress code.\\r\\n\\tThe status quo is seldom something to worry about.

Students, especially those in kindergarten or elementary school, are sensitive to what their teacher says about them.

There is no possibility that a person is only influenced by genetics alone; a person is \"made\" by adding up the genetic factors as well as the environmental factors that have affected him throughout his childhood. Criminals are not born to be criminals; rather, poverty creates the environment where a person could become a criminal. \\r\\n \\r\\n     If public assistance is not available to the people who need it, crime rates will rise. Poor parents or other family members will not see children starving to death; instead, they will do whatever they can to feed them and get them decent clothes, even if they have to steal. With higher crime rates, the taxpayer will have to pay an increased amount of taxes to achieve a higher security level for the local residential area around them. \\r\\n\\r\\n     I have read in an article about a woman with two sons who lives in Florida. She had come to a public school to make a speech. Her two sons were in jail for thift.

However, to survive, one must be willing to change.\\r\\n        First of all, if when one comes to a new environment, it is essential for one to adjust to it, whether one wants or not.   To illustrate, the new environments of middle schools in Korea seemed very rigorous to me, newly come from America .  I was astonished that students were abused physically almost on a regular basis and were forced to study late, sometimes depriving them of their sleep, under stern teachers who were preoccupied with money rather than education.   There were two choices possible for me to take.  One, adjust to the new conditions, or two, go back to America.  The second choice I could not take, so I had to force myself to adjust to the way of life of a normal middle school student in Korea.  The actual process was, no doubt, very strenous, but I managed it in the end.  If I hadn't changed, I couldn't have survived in Korea.\\r\\n        Secondly, we must also change when a change has occured in our environment.  In one part of Darwin's theory of evolution, natural selection states that only those who change into something advantageous in the new environment can survive.  For instance, imagine that due to the heavy smog of nearby factories, trees all over the country became black.  There are many different kinds of moths living on those trees.  Only the moths who have altered their body colors from white to a dark hue can survive, while the ones who have failed to do so are easily perceived by predators and eaten.  As we can see, only those who make changes are able to survive.\\r\\n         To sum up, unwilling to change means unwilling to survive.  Some people are conservative.  However, everyone must change in some way, slow or fast, small or radical, because the world is changing every minute, every second and the inhabitants must change with it.\",\n",

Although many scientists who are studying about human cloning insist that it will treat all of the incurablr diseases and have a beneficial effects, they also cannot prevent misuses of this technique. If it starts to be misapplicated, it will be the most awful human's creation Which makes our lives worse. It would ruin human's dignity and neglect human beings. Even many people will not consider murder as a serious crime because they can make a person whenever they want. The following resulf of human cloning would make our lives worse and more terrible. \\r\\n     The above exemples prove that changes do not always make our lives better.

Now we can actually see many disasters happening around us such as unexpected climate changes or heavy smog, which were once only seen on a TV. We can find the causes of most of the environmental pollution are the growth of population and the decrease of the forests.\\r\\nThe number of population has increased more rapidly in recent years. In 1960, the world’s population was three hundred million, and the population doubled in 40 years.  As the population grows, more cars, foods, and other things are produced and used in double the amount. The amount of waste and contamination doubles as well, causing serious pollutions to earth.\\r\\nForests play a very important role of purifying the air. Many of the forests are cut down and disappeared rapidly. Disappearance of the forests has severe effect on the pollution. Earth loses its ability to purify itself by the clearance of the huge areas of forests. This makes the pollution even worse along with the increasing population.\\r\\nThe best way to protect the environment would be that we all acknowledge the importance of environment and have the attitude to protect it. But the beginning could be suggested with regard the above two aspects. First, we all need to try to make less waste in the situation of population increase. They can ride bikes when going to nearby places or recycle wastes that can be reused. If these are done all over the world, it will be a great help to reduce the environmental pollution. Second, nations need to make agreements on cutting down the forests. For example, they can set limits on the number of trees to be cut from the forests. \\r\\nEarth loses its ability to support the increasing population and to clean itself by the disappearance of forests. Such things as riding bikes and saving forests would be a practical beginning to protect the earth.',\n",

She was, and still is, famous for her debating skills and her adherence to atheist principles. On the contrast, I had been raised up in a Christian envionment from my pre-school years, and did not view atheists as \"good people\" back then. Bami and I got along fine when we were freshmen, and she is actually one of my favorite friends now. However, we had a fight about religion when we had just started to be rommates. \\r\\n\\r\\n     Roommates are the ones that are the closest to you, at least in the physical sense, and Bami was no exception. We talked about a lot of things, and on the day we fought, our topic was religion. We disagreed on many points and eventually ended up shouting at each other. I disagreed with how she rejected the existence of God and the extrememly intolerant nature of the Christian Church. On the other hand, she could not stand my only-one-God theory and my assertion that everyone in this world had to be Christian. I said Jesus loved everyone, including you and me, but she said that I was only brainwashed into believing this because of my Christian environment. . \\r\\n\\r\\n     She made me angry back then; I did not talk to her for days, until I realized that some of what she said was actually true. I realized that I showe intolerance myself by rejecting all her assertions and laughing at them; and I realized that I really did not know what the love of God and Jesus was; I was only brainwashed in theories of the Christian Church. She made me understand myself and my religion better. And she pointed the flaws in my arguments that showed that I was actually intolerant of other people\\'s opinions. This was true because I became more open to others\\' religion and tried to at least \"understand\" the love of God before asserting it from that day on. \\r\\n\\r\\n     By fighting over religion with my roommate Bami, I learned to treat others more openly and tolerantly; I also understood myself and my religion in a deeper way.

I realized that I can learn more about myself by learning more about other people during my high school years in a band.\\r\\n     Since I got into a boarding school, I could experience many things I thought I would never experience. I have to meet people whether I like them or not because everyone lives in the same dormitory and goes to the same school. In a way, living in a boarding school is like living in a small society. As soon as I came to this school, I got accepted in a band as a guitarist. Other members of the band and I had to meet once in a week and practice for the performance. Because all the other members were boys, I had a very hard time fitting in. As I learned more about them- their taste in music, their personality, and so on- I learned more about myself and how different I was. They often didn't consider my opinions; for example, when I suggested what kind of songs I wanted to perform for the upcoming festival, they didn't give much thoughts and picked songs they liked. After several rejection, I realized how much I abhore being ignored. Also, I learned that they didn't really care about keeping the promise because they were often late for the practice. I learned that I am not a patient person and hate waiting. \\r\\n     I learned more about myself  as I learned more about them when the school festival started. As the perfomance date came closer, we talked about what we will do when we go up to the stage. The boys talked about jumping and head-banging during a song. As they got all excited about overacting in front of people, I realized how shy person I am. I dind't want to do any of the stuff they offered me to do. All I wanted to do was to give the audience the best sound I possibly could instead of focusing on other stupid actions. I was dumbfounded when the other members wanted to practice a new song for one day and perform, because I thought practicing for only one day wasn't enough. As I learned more about them, I could see that I was rather a perfectionist when it came to performing in front of all the students in my school. \\r\\n     There are so many people different from me, even in a small school like mine.

However, there are many peopkle whi prove that self-discipline is an essencial thing to make excellent results because it sometimes prevent us from doing evil deeds, and helps us to overcome any difficulty. Theodore Dreiser;s An American Tragedy and a historical person Hellen Keller's life substantiate this point of view.\\r\\n     A person who ruins his whole life because he does not consider self-discipline is well illustrated throughout An American Tragedy. The protagonist, Clyde, belongs to poor family and lives without any abundance. He always feels miserable about his circumstance, and has a desire to be included in the noble class who enjoy every luxurious things on earth. The strong ambition to belong to the noble class makes him leave his familu, and lose rationality. He is indulged in the money and luxury more and more, and even spends his money to buy an expensive dress for his girlfriend instead of his sister's medical fee. The more property he has, the stronger ambition controls him. Even he abandons his poor love, Roberta, to get a love from a rich girl, Sondra. However, Roberta tells him that she has Clyde's baby, and cannot handle this big deal. At this moment, Clyde fels that Roberta is an big obstacle to get into the noble class and decides to kill her. He pretends to want to have a date with Roberta on a boat, then pulls her into the pond to kill her. To achieve his dream, he never has self-discipline and acts everything he wants. Afterall, his crime is revealed by the police who detects Clyde's traces and people's statements, andis sentenced to death.\\r\\n     Unlike Cylde, Hellen Keller is a representative person who made the great accomplishments through having self-discipline. Originally, Hellen was one of the most miserable people in the world because she could not hear, see and talk. She could not conduct anything like the other people and represent what she want to do or want to eat. These tough conditions of Hellen made her desperate. However, she never gave her life and had self-discipline. She endured her difficulties and did her best, After all, she got into Harvard University, gave a lot of lectures to deliver hope to other handicapped people, and was respected by the world people. Because she had self-discipline and endured her difficulties, she could achieve the greater things than other people. \\r\\n     Throughout the two exemples, we can conclude that self-discipline is necessary to do something.

He led boycotts against prejudiced public services and won several times; it was through his effort that segregation disappeared from public transportation.

At this time, the Korean government did not have autonomy, and resistance to Japan was illegal behaviour. However, she was not concede her longing for freedom, and continued an independence movement. Although she violated Japanese legal authority, these her agitative actions encouraged many Korean people, and established the basis of Korean Independent. She was Yoo Kwan-soon who was killed by Japanese police at her 18 year-old-age. \\r\\n     In the movie, Braveheart, William Wallace also resisted to the authority for independence of Scotland. He was a real hero of Scotland and also killed by England government for a rebellion. However, his heroic deed was not a revolt but a struggle for freedom and independence. He willingly sacrificed himself for Scottish people, and produced bright achievements. ; he conquered English forces at Stirling Battle, though Stirling’s topographical condition was in a disadvantageous position. After all, Scotland became an independent nation that could not be formed without defiance of hero as William Wallace.\\r\\n    Nowadays, not only injustices legal authority, but also people’s effort for restraining it and getting freedom are still remaining around us. It is a challenge, which has to be continued, and an essential thing for the development of society.',\n",

This was because Rome had always cheated Carthage when sighing treaties, forcing Carthaginians to either adhere to the treaties and starve or fight a war they couldn't win. After winning the third Poenic War, the Romans surrounded the capital of Carthage, demanding that in exchange for safety the Carthaginians surrender all weapons. If the Carthaginians had adequate knowledge of their past, they would not have trusted the deceitful Romans.

Abraham Lincoln was one such person.\\r\\n\\r\\nToday, many people revere Lincoln as one of the greatest presidents of the US. However, Lincoln's political career was full of failures and mistakes. Lincoln made a rather humble beginning as a politician; when he was young he made speeches in community meetings. After a few years as a successful lawyer, Lincoln ran for the position of mayor, but failed. He later ran twice for the position of  governor, both of which were bitter failures. However, Lincoln did not despair. To him, each defeat was another opportunity to further understand his people. Finally, after long years of inappropriate policies, poor speeches, and defeats, Lincoln became the President of the United States. The bad decisions he had made during his younger years helped him ultimately become one of history's most successful politicians.\\r\\n\\r\\nDeng Xiaoping was another politician who learned by making a bad decision. In the 1970s, many chinese college students were holding demonstrations for a more democratic China. As the prime minister, Deng felt that these students were a threat to the State, and ordered soldiers to shoot the protesters. The foolishness of this decision was soon realized as the world appalled at the Tiananmen Square massacre. However, Deng's bad decision ultimately benifitted China. Had Deng not taken action, the State would never have recognized the need for reform. It was better for Deng to make the bad decision than make no decision at all.\\r\\n\\r\\nBad decisions are indeed painful experiences.

I believe the best way to understand oneself is to write a journal. By expressing our reactions to everyday occurrences, we can infer from the journal a comprehensive picture of ourselves.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe method of using a journal to discover oneself has been used by many intellectuals. Ernest Hemingway, Aristotle, Marcus Aurelius, Nietzche; these are just a few of many thinkers whose journals still exist today. Many of them wrote in their journals that writing daily about their thoughts truly helped them discover themselves. Hemingway described his journal as a mirror to his heart, while Nietzche portrayed it as the inner self. Biographers say that of all the sources they use to write biographies, they use journals the most. Journals enable people, as well as the writer himself, to study the writer's thoughts and emotions.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother reason why keeping a journal is an effective method is because of its honesty. People have many secrets; thoughts that they want to keep within themselves, emotions that they have but never want to portray. Without taking these into account, one cannot create an accurate description of oneself. The journal is a means by which people can extract these secrets into the open. Since no one else will see a private journal, one can freely express his feelings and opinions. Journals are a safe method of being completely honest with oneself, and ultimately, truly understanding oneself.\\r\\n\\r\\nJournal are a widely acclaimed and safe way of truly understanding oneself. Intellectuals and their biographists alike have confirmed how  through journals we can express our inner selves safely.

Dodos, Columbia Shuttle disaster, and The Old Man and the Sea all demonstrate this point.\\r\\n     Dodos were common birds in Madagascar in the eighteenth century. However, human expeditions introduced predators that quickly decimated every single dodos. It was not until dodos were introduced in Lewis Caroll's Alice in Wonderland that people started recalling what they have done to the dodos; they introduced a new species without thinking about the consequence, which lead to dodos' extinction. Various campaigns started in order to increase awareness of the near-extinct animals. Because of people made a mistake regarding the dodos, endagered animals such as the grey whales are acknowledged and could be saved.\\r\\n     In February 2003, Space Shuttle Columbia disintegrated during its re-entry to Earth. Deluge of investigations started revealing that tiles were damaged during its launch but NASA ignored the damage. If NASA engineers had looked carefully into the damage and fixed it before its re-entry, such calamity could have been avoided. As a result of the knowledge gained from the Columbia disaster, NASA was more careful about its next launch, Discovery, which finished its mission successfully.\\r\\n     Santiago in the Old Man and the Sea had gone more than 80 days without catching a single fish.

The infamous Columbine incident is one of them.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn a fine Spring day at Columbine high school, two students arrived at the school armed with automatic rifles and shortguns.

Deeply influenced by western culture, they felt that their communist government should give more freedom to its citizens. The Party disagreed; it thought the protesters were a threat to what it thought were 'ideal' principles. This disagreement led to an infamous massacre; thousands of student protesters were killed by the military. However, this dissent ultimately transformed China.

The disagreement in the 1970s led to progress, making China today;s asian superpower.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother disagreement, further back in history, led to progress. In the 19th century, the US was divided into the Union and the Confederacy. The two sides were in disagreement about the issue of slavery. The Union states felt that slaves should be freed and treated as equal americans, while the Confederate states wanted to keep using slaves for their cotton industry. The disagreement became so severe that a civil war erupted, ending no less than a decade afterwards. Although the war ravaged much of America's southern states, it brought about great progress in many fields. Many literary works were created during the post-war period, and policy reforms during the same period improved the living standards of citizens. The war also sparked great progress in America's industry creating a formidable industry that later made America a superpower.\\r\\n\\r\\nDisagreement looks like it hinders progress, but on the contrary,  it is the very spark of improvement.

I have learned this lesson through my observation in high school.\\r\\n     Because the high school I am currently attending is located in the mountains and there is nothing around except tress, many parents want their children to attend my school and focus on studing. Although it became very competitive to be accepted, one girl managed to enroll during the semester, which is very rare. However, she was not at all happy about attending my school.

Students in my school didn't enjoy listening to her complaints, and some even hated her for talking negatively about the school. She didn't do any work to achieve high grades and eventually transferred to another school. Instead of making efforts to survive, she blew away her advantages she could only have in my school.\\r\\n     Another big change students in my school face as they start their high school life is the fact that it's a boarding school.

Some who have very intimate relationship with their family members often find it difficult to accept the reality. Many freshmen spend every night crying. Many students drop out in the beginning of the year because they simply can't take the pressure. However, those who are willing to change to the new school are the one who survive.

Her life was filled with challenge and giving, which deepely impressed and influenced me.\\r\\n\\r\\n     Helen Adams Keller was the daughter of Captain Arthur Henley Keller and Kate Adams Keller and born with full sight and hearing. However, when she was 19 months old, she was down with scarlet fever. The illness did not last long, but it left her deaf, blind, an unable to speak. The following few years proved very hard for Helen and her family. Helen became a very difficult child, smashing dishes and lamps and terrorizing the whole household with her screaming. Kate Keller looked for a teacher who can take care of her and open her mind, and she finally found Anne Sullivan. Anne Sullivan struggled at first, but eventually succeeded to tame Helen. Anne\\'s efforts made Helen a good student and Helen attended Perkins Institute for the Blind, Wright-Humason School for the Deaf, and the Cambridge School for Young Ladies. Finally she entered Radcliffe College and graduated from it cum laude. Considering she cannot see or hear, it was astonishing to me that Helen could get into such a good college and graduate from it cum laude.\\r\\n\\r\\n     After graduating from the college, she made it her own life\\'s mission to fight for the sensorially handicapped in the world. In 1915 she founded Helen Keller International, a non-profit organization for preventing blindness. With a tremendous willpower, she became a world-famous speaker and author, too. Helen and Anne Sullivan traveled all over the world to over 39 countries, and made several trips to Japan, becoming a favorite of the Japanese people. As an author, she wrote 11 books such as \"Light in my Darkness\" and numerous articles. This, too, amazed me since she was not overwhelmed by her difficulty, but participated in society actively and even helped others suffering from disabilities.\\r\\n\\r\\n     Getting to know Helen Keller was a truly overwhelming experience; it changed my view of the obstacles I would encounter in my life. Before I learned about her life, I easily gave up when confronted with obstacles and I thought I could not care about others when dealing with difficulties. The life of Helen Keller, however, made me more willing to overcome adversity and care about others even when I am suffering from obstacles.',\n",

Making cigarettes illegal will ruin smokers’ lives by leading them to become addicted to even more addictive drugs such as alcohols or marihuana.\\r\\nThe action movies will become less exciting by not showing the action scenes made by the help of cigarettes. To actors, smoking gives the image of strongness and most of the blowing up scenes in action movies are mostly made by burning cigarettes: an actor throws a burning cigarette that he was smoking to the floor, and suddenly it burns a tank full of gas and “boom!” the bad guy dies. If cigarettes become illegal, this kind of exciting scene would no more be seen in action movies.\\r\\nIt can be said that banning cigarettes decrease the population of smokers. But since cigarettes are very addictive, banning cigarettes instantly will bring up more problems such as increase of the population of drinkers or drug addiction.

One's single-mindedness in the pursuit of one's goals can make one care less about other matters that are also significant, and such negligence can lead to a tragic result. In European history, we can find a compelling example that supports this thesis.\\r\\n\\r\\n     The French Revolution is a good example of devastating consequence caused by single-mindedness in the pursuit of goals. When Louis XVI inherited the crown, the French government had been heavily indebted and the bourgeoisie was getting power. When American colonists declared independence from Britain and the American Revolution broke out, the French royalty decided to assist the colonists because the royalty hated Britain.\\r\\n\\r\\n     Getting heavily involved in the Revolution, the French government worsened its financial conditions. As a result, the government had to increase its tax revenues. However, treating the bourgeoisie unfairly while trying to tax them, the government evoked the bourgeoisie's wrath. Their resentment led to the outbreak of the French Revolution, and many members of the royalty such as Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette were executed during the Revolution. In this historical event, the French royalty was so focused on the American Revolution as to fail to consider the financial conditions of the French government. Although the American colonists gained independence, the royalty faced a devastating result, the French Revolution.\\r\\n\\r\\n     As the example of the French Revolution shows, success sometimes can be disastrous. It is important to focus on the goal when we are trying to achieve it. However, the concentration sometimes make us forget to deal with other important matters, which can result in disastrous failure.\",\n",

The U.S. and the U.S.S.R. competed to produce more effective missiles and send men to the moon. During President Kennedy's term, the U.S.S.R. sent missiles across the Atlantic Ocean to store them in cuba. From Cuba, the missiles could reach Washington D.C. and New York in an instant. The safety of the country's citizens was at stake. If the U.S.S.R. decided to attack those cities with missiles, there would be not enough time to detect the attack. This attack could also incite the Third World War, resulting in more casualties and destruction than the Second World war. Mr. Kennedy had to make a quick decision, he had to stop Kruschev from attempting to store those missiles. He ordered the Navy to warn the Russian ships and contacted Kruschev to stop those ships. Thanks to Mr. Kennedy's quick decision, the U.S. did not endure another war.\\r\\n            Last month, instead of men threatening men, nature hurt people.

Unfortunately, human is too weak to survive in rigorous nature; human does not have strong claws, big wings, fast legs or hard horns. In order to survive, human had to live with collaborating othe people and this made society naturally. As human civilizations develop, human gained enough power to survive in the nature alone and the huge societies in past seems not to exist anymore. Yet the importance of the society is still important not only in physical aspects but also psychological aspects.\\r\\n           One may argue that human is able to live alone by saying the case of Robinson Crusoe; since he lives alone in an island and does everything himself, it seems that Robinson Crusoe has nothing to do with societies. Nevertheless, one can 'exist' but cannot 'be' without society. The innate genetic traits are necessary but not sufficient for my identity. We can only receive the rest informations of identity by having relations with other people in society. For example, my name and my words are useless if no one says and hears. What is 'Robinson Crusoe' if no one says his name? What is he saying if no one hears? Therefore, there are no more walls between me and the society. In additions, we are not living in an island alone like Robinson Crusoe. As long as we co-work, the society is still essential to human\\r\\n         Of course one has personal freedom through solitude. Solitude is necessary since it gives a chance to reflect and reorganize oneself by combining scattered ideas in one's brain.

Some teachers teach only what is in the book while others choose to complement the book with what they have experienced to be helpful.

Accordingly, colleges offer courses with active learning to help students understand.

Instead of just listening to lectures based on a book, students are encouraged to engage in discussions, conduct a research, and work at internships. Books cannot help students in knowing how to react in every single situation they may face. So at University of Pennsylvania, one example of a college offering active learning, students can apply for joint programs. Jerome Fisher Program allows students to not only study with textbooks but also to cooperate with organizations or companies to conduct a study that may aid students for real-life applications of what they learned in class. These courses are more helpful in understanding the material taught in class than courses taught with books only.\\r\\n              When I first learned French, I did so with a book.

After the students graduate,  companies hire the graduates who achieved high grades and promote employees who earned the most.\\r\\n     The problem of result and process has been one of the most controversial issues. Some of my classmates argue that they should receive good scores if they triy hard, but other students argue that the students should be graded as the result they make.\\r\\n      In my opinion, due process prcedes good result. Although students do not make good results, they earn something while they try hard. About a year ago I had to prepare a presentation for my U.S history class.

He recorded the progress of each task and commented on his performance to improve his time management. By using his time well, Benjamin Franklin managed to be an active member of the government, make scientific discoveries, found a college, and write an autobiography. Franklin’s use of time shows that doing the work beforehand is wiser than procrastinating.\\r\\n\\r\\n           In middle school, I learned that putting off work is not auspicious.

Person who does not make mistake usually work on only what they need to do and do not think about creative stuff.

Millard Fuller, the foundr of the Habitat for Humanity, also gave up his material possessions to help the homeless. These examples show that people are more motivated by conscience.\\r\\n           In 1999, the citizens of the United States were shocked by the news that two high school students killed more than ten students. These two seniors of Columbine High School in Colorado had planned the shooting beforehand. They worshipped Hitler and loathed the teachings in the Bible. Before shooting the students in the school, the perpetrators asked, \"Do you believe in God?\" Among the students shot, Cassie Bernall is now famous for saying yes to the question. Only a junior in high school, Cassie had so many dreams she wanted to pursue and plans for the future. Despite her plans, she answered yes because her conscience told her that was right.

In addition, progress for humanity causes destruction for mother nature.

As these babies mature, the directors in the baby-producing facilities condition the children to like certain types of movies and books. LIke the society in the book, the current society we live in neglects the unprivileged people. Many pregnant women of the lower class who smoke ultimately give birth to babies exposed to less oxygen and more carbon monoxide in cigarettes. The upper and middle-class live in a much more privileged environment but fail to recognize that the lower class should also be entitled to live in such conditions. The progress has allowed for more comfortable lives for hte upper and middle-class but not the lower class.\\r\\n              Furthermore, the progress has brought changes in our environment.

Cars were manufactured to provide individuals a means of transportation, but the population caused by those cars cause asthma in people and animals. The fossil fuels cause global warming because they emit more carbon into air. Deforestation for more land to develop causes the animals to be deprived of their habitat.\\r\\n            Progress may seem beneficial at first but the aftermath shows that the changes are not absolutely benevolent. Progress benefits the upper and middle class more than the lower class. Altogether, the advanced technology negatively affects the humanity and the animals.

Another owner of fried chicken store started to give a soap which was made by oil which was naturally made after making fried chickens in order for recycle, and the owner sold chickens as twice as the owner had sold previously. Those items would have not been invented if there was no IMF crisis.\\r\\n\\tThe second example of the chance in crisis is Hansin, a general of Han, an ancient dynasty of China. When Hansin was to fight against Jae, another ancient dynasty of China, with much less army, he arranged his army right in front of the river. Generally this formation was foolish because the soldiers have no place to run away and they may be all drowned. When enemy saw the formation of Hansin’s army they regarded as the most stupid general in the world. However, the soldiers of Hansin fought much better than those of Jae because the soldiers of Hansin used all their power on the battle since they realized that they could not run away. As a result, Hansin overcame the lack of the number of his soldiers and defeated Jae. \\r\\n\\tIn the paragraphs above I have shown the examples of the cleverness in crisis. It is hard to explain scientifically why people become cleverer in crisis, but it is sure that it actually happens.',\n",

       " ('“If a human body costs one thousand dollar, two eyes cost nine hundred dollar” is a Korean proverb. Actually, seeing is the main way of human perception among five senses: seeing, smelling, tasting, hearing and touching. However, people depend on seeing so much that they believe something as they see. However, the history shows that this is not true. Mirage in desert, Pang Tong in ancient China, and the Allegory of the Cave can be good examples of this assertion that seeing can be misleading.\\r\\n\\tThe first example of incorrectness of seeing is a mirage in desert. For the people who travel through the desert, water supply is the most significant. If the water is depleted, they easily die because of the lack of the water because it is almost impossible to supply the water in the desert. When they find an oasis, they rest and supply the water at oasis. Unfortunately, what they found is often a mirage and they try to seek it in vain. They saw an oasis, but it is actually hallucination.\\r\\n\\tThe second example of misleading of seeing is Pang Tong. Pang Tong is an ancient person in China. According to the records, He was so ugly that people who encounter Pang Tong avoided him. Since many lords in China detested his ugliness, they did not employ him. However, Liu Bei, one of the lords at that time, employed him because Liu Bei found that Pang Tong is wise and intelligent. As a consequence, Liu Bei conquered many countries despite his weakness since Pang Tong supported him.\\r\\n                      The Allegory of the Cave is the last example of the wrongness of seeing. According to Plato, who made the Allegory of the Cave, prisoners are tied in the cave and they are unable to turn their heads around. They only see the shadows of the things which were made by the fire on the back of them and they regard those shadows as the true things. However, if one is untied and goes outside the cave, one sees, smells, hears, tastes, and touches the true things. Unfortunately, one tries to explain that the shadows what the prisoners see are in fact false but prisoners do not believe him or her since they only saw the shadows.\\r\\n                    We are often force to judge the thing by only seeing them. This is absolutely danger and harmful. In order to find the truth, we should rely on not only seeing but every five senses and deep consideration.',\n",

However, do people who are so great do not fail in their lives? No way it is the truth because of many examples we see. There is one thing those people who have succeeded in their lives say, \"Failure is the seed of success of their lives.\" Even though there are countless ones in the history who fit for this saying, but I believe Thomas Edison and Marie Curie are the best.\\r\\n\\r\\n    Thomas Edison is so famous that he does not have to be described, but to make sure, he was the \"King of Invention.\" He patented more than at least 10,000 inventions, and the most famous ones are light bulb and gramophone. To the ordinaries\\' point of view, he certainly is a genius of the century, but according to himself, it is not so. As the famous incident goes, when Edison was asked by a reporter after inventing the light bulb what makes up genius, he answered, \"1 percent of intellegence and 99 percent of endeavor.\" As if to prove his words, he had tried over 3,000 different materials for the filament of his light bulb. All he tried were failure, but eventually, those bitter falldown paid off later as the new source of light. Surely, from his example, people can look back their ill successful life, and try again for success.\\r\\n\\r\\n    If Edison was searching hard for material for his inventions, Curie was doing so for new element. Curie is a chemist born in Poland, but spent most of her life in France. She won two Nobel Prizes, because of her astonishing discovery of new elements that are critical in modern chemistry. The substance her husband and she found is called radium, radioactive matter. They had to overcome their miserable state first, because they had put their every part of income into their experiment. They had to walk several leagues to get to the marketplace while their neighbors used cabs and carriages. Second, they had to beat the exhausting process of their experiment. One biography said the work was too exhausting that this made Curies out of work for 3 days each time they conducted their experiment. Even though the amount of effort they put into their discovery turned out to be failure, they did not let go of the hope, and tried different ways to reach the result. We all know that they finally succeeded in having radium, and their story is likely to be the lead example for the quote given.\\r\\n\\r\\n    To succeed is not something that comes right into people\\'s hand, but by endless encounter with fearful, annoying, exhausting works. To let go of their goal, however, because of the amount of work they face is not something clever. For those who are likely to give up, ther is the famous saying, \"Failure can sow the seeds of success,\" and humanities\\' history gives it the perfect certificate. They can turn their eyes on many antecedents like Edison or Curie. Failure is not something to be afraid of, but to cope with, and be familiar with to be the better person.',\n",

       " (\"Nowadays, humans eat meat. They consume great amount of meat everyday, and that sometimes causes health problems. However, is this meat-eating habit a nature to human? I do not think so because of many biological and genetical proofs.\\r\\n\\r\\n    The genetical ancestor of humanity is a group called Primates, and it is related to apes and monkeys. For scientists, meat-eating habit of human has been a big controversial point, because our genetical ancestors were not carnivorous. They were very close to herbivorous animals, and rarely consumed meat. All they ate for protein was insects or ticks on their companion's body. During their entire life, our ancestors ate fruits and leaves on trees, which they live on and moved to the next ground for new food. That feature is recorded in DNA and passed down from generation to generation, and finally reached to human beings. From this feature, I believe meat-eating habit is not a human nature.\\r\\n\\r\\n    There are numerous differences between herbivores and carnivores, but the biggest difference is the length of intestines. Anatomically, herbivores have intestines ranging over 9 to 11 meters, whereas carnivores have relatively shorter intestines from 6 to 8 meters. It is because of the food they devour. Meat consists of protein, and this is something that is not easy to digest inside stomach because it can rot in about 12 hours. Therefore, carnivores developed shorter intestines to prevent their meals rotting inside their body. Grass comprises fibers, and they do not rot easily inside intestines. Furthermore, fibers are not very easy to digest, and hence, herbivores have to develop long intestines. Humans are somewhat in between herbivores and carnivores in terms of the length of entrails. Nevertheless, human beings are closer to herbivores because their entrails are too long to be a meat-eaters.\\r\\n\\r\\n    Nowadays, humanities have millions of different dishes to choose for their meal. It is true that human beings prefer to eat meat rather than vegetables and fruits. That led some people to think human race originally had the nature of eating meats. But, thanks to science, such myth is broken. Anatomically, humans are definitely grass-eaters, and genetically, they are very close to herbivores. That does not mean, however, that humans must not eat meats, but it is recommended to increase the consume of vegetables.\",\n",

At that time, I had high esteem, and that is because I was the best clarinetist in my year. That went too far, and the esteem turned into \"pride and prejudice.\" From that point, I looked at other clarinetists in my school with belittling attitude, and tried to be in every situation including a clarinetist in it. However, such bad attitude came to an abrupt end.\\r\\n\\r\\n    As always, like other marching bands, this marching band practice everyday with full enthusiasm.

Some group of bacteria decompose dead bodies of animals and plants, thus enabling the world to be full of new resources and energy source.

This phenomenon can be explained by this psychological term, \"the fear of the unknown.\" People do not know what is lying there behind the change.

Before the invention of television people had to go to sport event, plays, or listen to radio for entertainment. However, due to the invention of televisions humans were able to experience diverse entertainments. Despite some disadvantages it might have, televisions have made us communicate more between family members and even friends. Therefore, I strongly disagree with the statement above. Through the use of several examples, I will demonstrate that television actually offers more opportunities for communication.  \\r\\nFirst, television allows families and friends to experience entertainment in a setting where they can discuss their opinions freely and openly. Before the invention of televisions where people had to go see plays and sport events, they weren’t allowed to talk freely. Instead they were required to keep silent during the entertainment. Moreover, not all the family members could view the entertainment. However, today the entire family even the young babies could watch television together and can even discusses their opinions of television shows or news events. By looking at this fact, it clearly shows that televisions have created more communication between family members and even friends. \\r\\nAnother example of television creating more communications can be found in my family. Since, I have to go to Korean academy school and my dad comes home late, our family doesn’t have that much time to communicate with each other. However, when we are watching television shows my dad and I start to communication more than before. Last week when our family was watching a soccer match between Korea and Sweden, we actually communicated a lot. We talked about my school life, my dads company and even debated on the skills of the Korean national soccer team. This was some kind of an experience that doesn’t happen often, without television our family wouldn’t have that much time to sit together and communicate with each other. \\r\\nThus, television has not destroyed communication between family and friends. In fact, television offers more opportunities for families to be together and communicate with each other. By looking at my own experience I come to a firm conclusion that television has not destroyed communication between family members, instead televisions has allowed families to be together.',\n",

Some advocate that children can experience more advantage such as enhanced pronunciation when learning at a young age.\\r\\nHowever, I personally disagree with the statement that children should begin learning a foreign language as soon as they start school, because it will be hard for the children to study both their native and foreign language at the same time.\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst children should feel comfortable speaking their native language before learning a foreign language.\\r\\nWhen children start school, their education is focused on learning their native language.  If children are taught a foreign language while learning their native language it will be hard for them to study two languages at the same time. The children won’t be able to even speak their native language instead there is a high possibility that they will be confused which language is which. \\r\\n\\r\\nFor example, when I went to Singapore when I just started school, it was hard for me to learn English and Korean at the same time. I remember myself being confused which language is which; I often mixed Korean and English while I was communicating. There is a major difference in English and Korean pronunciation, and since I learned both languages at a young age my Korean pronunciation isn’t clear. It seems like I am speaking in English even though I am talking in Korean. \\r\\n\\r\\nChildren should learn a foreign language but not at an early age. When they start school their education should be focused only on their native language. When learning a second language while the native language isn’t perfect, children will have hard time learning and will be confused. By looking at these reasons I strongly disagree with the statement above that children should begin learning a foreign language as soon as they start school.',\n",

We are now able to work or study at home in front of the television or computers instead of being stuck in the traffic going to workplace or to school. By working or studying at home we can reduce and use the time more efficiently however there are some disadvantages to this. When studying at home instead of going to school, many students will find it hard to concentrate and won’t be easy to get help from teachers. By looking at this reason I would prefer to study at a traditional school.\\r\\n\\r\\nStudents can get distracted easy when studying at home in front of television and computers. About three years ago, Korean students were able to study by themselves without going to Korean academy by watching educational program or by using the internet. I also used computer for studying, however I was really easily distracted preventing me from fully concentrating on the educational program. I kept surfing the net and chatting with my friends while I was listening to the education program. This wasn’t just happening to me, the majority of students couldn’t concentrate when they are in front of the computer. \\r\\n\\r\\nAlso, when studying alone students won’t be able to get help from teachers. If a student isn’t clear or needs help with the studying they are doing, asking a question to the teacher won’t be possible since they are learning by watching the television or using the internet. If I have a question on what I am learning, I need to fully understand it before I could move on to the next stage. Therefore for students like me who learn by watching television and computer will face disadvantage. \\r\\n\\r\\nWith the development of technology, to some students studying at their house by watching television or computers will help them. However it will not work for me. When I study in front of the computer or television, I get distracted easily preventing me to fully concentrate.

       " (\"Some people say life is the choice itself, because they believe life is full of choice. Everyone face choice between this thing and that thing, and he or she often have dilema. I believe it is true that people reveal themselves through their decision, and others can learn about the person by examining his or her choice.\\r\\n\\r\\n    The most suitable example in the history is Napoleon I. He was the emperor of France after the French Revolution. During his reign, Napoleon accomplished many things that no one ever did, and what he did and what he decided shows his personality and his moral value. The best example, though, is the war against Russia. Napoleon was at his peak when he decided to wage a war against Russia, and that risked everything he had. Why he did so is not certain, even though historians believe it is the combination of desire to rule larger land and the stubbornness. Napoleon knew that he would lose everything he had, but still, he went to Russia with his troops, and by this, People nowadays conclude Napoleon was filled with stubbornness, desire to get, and conceit.\\r\\n\\r\\n    If Napoleon shows a negative side, George Washington shows positive side. As the genaral and the leader of Americans, Washington showed his full ability and personality through his choice. One famous story about his youth certainly proves the quote. When he was about 5 years old, his father found out that one of his favorite orchard tree is chopped with an axe. Furious, Washington's father wanted to know who did such barbarious deed. Then, George Washington came out and admitted his wrong deed. From that point, Washington is known to be very honest and frank. Not only that, his countless military decisions suggest that he is a very resolute person. He once had a choice of going down a stream with his troops either by rafts or by horses. It was cold winter, but they had to get down fast to pursuit English troops. Therefore, Washington chose rafts to reach the battlefield faster, even though he had to take blames of his soldiers that the weather was very cold. His decision was right, because his troops got to the battle ground just before the American troops were about to collapse.\\r\\n\\r\\n    Once, there was an interesting research about decisions, and even though people make decision consciously, there goes a lot of subconscious thinkings. According to the scientists who conducted the research, that subconscious thinkings are what we take in as the personality of the person. What people do not think consciously is actually their original character, and such things appear on their choices. Hence, I agree with the quote given firmly.\",\n",

However, I do not agree with them because things that were clear become complex to understand in everyday life.\\r\\n\\r\\n    I sometimes feel so, when I study something that is not familiar to me. Mathematics is one example, because when I take class and listen to a teacher explaining how the formula is drawn out, it seems that I understand everything on the blackboard. This phenomenon happens very much in trigonometric function. However, when I start doing homework, the formula that I considered as a piece of cake becomes a labyrinth that no one can ever go through. What I want to say is that something theoritical seems easy, but when it is applied to the real world, it is not so. Therefore, there exists some things that were straightforward, but then they become complicated as time passes.\\r\\n\\r\\n    Music is another great example of the quote given, because when my companions in band and I get the music sheet with many notes on it, we all believe we can go through it by just sight-reading it. For example, There is a piece called \"the Fairest of the Fair\" by John Philip Sousa, one of the most famous American composer. This piece is a lively song with up-beat rhythm. When my band listened to it, everyone considered it as a easy one. However, this required more than my band expected since it took 3 months to play perfectly, without any flaw. such incident happens in music practicing because music is not something that players play notes. Music is the expression, and without it, music is just a group of sounds. Hence, when practicing music, players feel that something seemed simple gets harder and more complex as time passes.\\r\\n\\r\\n    As science progresses, the idea that the problem will become easire to understand as time goes is firmly settled in people\\'s mind.

They insist on the cruelty and the inefficiency of this fatal sentence. I also strongly believe this penalty protects us from murderers.\\r\\n\\r\\n    Murder is something very harsh, and ruthless. It finishes someone\\'s life, almost always against his/her will. That is why people think death penalty is the best protection from a murderer. But, there are several authentic researches conducted on this matter, and they are contradicting the norm people had. First, researches figured out the majority of murderers, who were sentenced to death, were impulsive, or overwhelmed by their anger and instinct, when they committed \"unforgetable crime.\" According to researches, this group is the one who would consider murdering someone again the last thing to do in their life.  To these people, death penalty is just harsh punishment that takes away their opportunity to regain their innocence and dreams of their life.\\r\\n\\r\\n    Second, researchers aimed at murderers who were not impulsive, but murderers who \"prepared\" to commit crime found out an interesting factor. Most of such murderers confessed that they committed horrible sin because they knew there was the death penalty waiting for them. These people had other serious crimes, and those crimes already lead them to the final sentence. They see no difference between dying without killing someone and dying after murdering someone. They say they will die anyway, and that is why they murdered someone. From that point, researchers concluded that if there was no death penalty, the rate of murderers would go down greatly. \\r\\n\\r\\n    Human beings is not a perfect divine being, and hence, they make mistakes, and sometimes the mistake is irrevocable. Murdering someone is irreversible mistake, but the way to react to it is also irreversible. People who killed other, or others, have their own stories, and such stories become evidences that the death penalty is not efficient enough to protect citizens from homicide.',\n",

Thus, I believe patience is a very crucial characteristic.\\r\\n\\r\\n    Also, patience comes with many other meaningful virtues that is helpful in real life. A person who is patient is calm in many threatening situation, and he or she thinks more deeply than others. People who are patient is calm because they know that they can wait, and while they are waiting, they do not have to be angry or busy. Therefore, they are usually calm in very most situations.

Each group has their own reasons why they believe so, but I am with the con-war because I believe war can never be justified. War is something that takes away millions of lives of people and disables countries involved in war. I believe those facts are enough to not justify wars.\\r\\n\\r\\n    Nowadays, American troops are fighting in Iraq against insurgents, but they never gain superior position against Iraqi insurgents. The war in Iraq is ended, but it still affects people in Iraq, and what is left is unstable life of civilians and troops.  Almost always, American troops are killed in suicide bomb attacks and the increasing speed of death rate is accelerating. Also, Iraqi civilians are killed with American troops just because they were passing by. In my opinion, whoever it is, civilians should not be killed in such situation because they are not involved with it. The war brought chaos of death in Iraq, not peace, and which makes war never be justified.\\r\\n\\r\\n    Traditionally, war was a wasting activity among 2 or more countries. When the war is started, people die, villages are destroyed, governmental system stops working, and everything becomes chaotic. In World War II, France under German forces were hopeless, and they could do nothing alone. The war has disabled the country. Usually, in the past, war had winner and loser, or winners and losers, and almost always, winners prosperred after the war since the nation that lost in the war compensated the harm they have done to the winner. However, nowadays, it is hard to distinguish winner and loser because countries involved in war are destroyed in similar degree. For example, In Korean War, both North Korea and South Korea were destroyed to ground, and nothing was firmly standing. War not only devastated materialistic things, it also broke hope of citizens. This is something that should be kept away, and thus, war should never be justified.\\r\\n\\r\\n    War is something devastating, and that made people avoid it. But sometimes poeple wage war against each other and destroy great amount of their opponent's national foundation. There are always people who oppose war and they say war can never be justified. Truly, war is not something that can be justified. It destroys human life, and it destroys not only nations involved in it, but also the hope of citizens. I believe those are enough to make war unforgivable.\",\n",

Most students do not know what they want to pursue as a career when they enter university.

       " ('In the medical lab, thousands of animals are used as \"research material\" for the development of new vaccines. Mice are used for muscle-related and nerve system-related medicine, and sometimes chimpanzees and other apes are used for the medicine for AIDS. Even though there are many people who oppose animal testing in medicine research, I personally believe that without animal testing, we could not have achieved what it is today in medical field, and also, there would be no safety guaranteed. Without animal testing, there would be no way for the researchers to test their drugs but human beings, and that is too risky.\\r\\n\\r\\n    The biggest concern in medical labs is the safety. Medicine requires test before its delivery to the market, and obviously medicine should be used to the one who has the disease. However, researchers cannot just inject medicine to a human being with the disease, because they have to examine the person for a long time. People have the right to be free, but if they are \"used\" for the medical experiment, they do not have the right any more, because they should not spread the disease they are carrying for the experiment. That means a person is confined until the researchers are satisfied. However, since human beings are extremely social, they need to be in the society, and that means they can spread disease to other people, which is certainly not safe.\\r\\n\\r\\n    There is another safety problem, and that appears when the drug is on the market. there are millions of people who do not share any characteristics. Therefore, people have different reactions to the same drug, and some of them are fatal. To be able to guarantee 100 percent safety, researchers should have countless experiments with the new medicine. But, the problem is that if they cannot experiment with animals, then they should do it with human beings. That means researchers have less opportunity to find rare reaction cases to the drug. Also, human beings with particular disease in their body may not be many around the world especially with some fatal diseases like AIDS or cancer. To make sure there is no safety mistake, hence, animal testing proves the safety of development of medicine.\\r\\n\\r\\n    Animal testing allows medicine producers to assure their buyers the safety of their product. Animals in the lab have less chance of spreading disease than human being because animals can be kept in one place for many years while human beings, a social one, cannot be treated like that. Also, allowance of animal testing gives medicine producers more chance to experiment, and that is greatly related to the safety, since that means there is more chance of finding a rare counteraction case to the vaccine. Thus, animal testing ensures the safety of medicine.',\n",

Even someone who achieved a great deal in their field makes a lot of mistakes. They make mistakes and correct their mistakes afterwards, and end up achieving something by correcting them. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I was applying to various high schools as a junior high student, after taking a test at one of the schools that I applied to and failing it, I was afraid that I may fail again in other schools. I was afraid of making mistakes solving problems again that I almost gave up applying to the schools I wished to enter. If I had given up just because I was afraid of making mistakes, I wouldn't even have entered the school I am in right now.  \\r\\n\\r\\nAlbert Einstein, the genius who created relativity, didn't come up with the perfect idea from the beginning.  After he wrote his paper on special relativity, he realized that the concept did not apply in every case. When he realized that, he began thinking about a general law that could be applied to everything, and he came up with general relativity. However, afterwards he even made a mistake of adding the cosmological constant in one of his equations to explain his universe that does not expand. He corrected it again later. This example of the genius who represents physics of 20th century shows us clearly that even the one who made one of the greatest feats in human history makes mistakes. \\r\\n\\r\\nIf someone does not make any mistake at all, it is impossible to achieve anything. From the greatest figures of history like Michelangelo, Einstein, Socrates, etc. to our neighbors, if any one of them had been afraid of making mistakes and did nothing at all, no work would've been done. There would be no great works of art, philosophy, or science. By making mistakes we advance a step further and achieve something. There is no exception in that statement.\",\n",

For instance, people can easily judge some situation when they stay neutral, but if their friends are involved, all of a sudden, the situation become hard to judge because this involvement makes people one-sided, rather than staying neutral. Remaining neutral and impartial does help people to make better observations and discoveries.\\r\\n     Galileo is the scientist who brought up the helio-centric world idea. It was possible for him to come up with this idea because he stayed neutral from church, which forbid people from thinking scientifically at the time. If Galileo believed everything that church said, then he might not have noticed the helio-centric idea even after he observed it. There also is a famous person who broke all superstitions about comets. He observed comets carefully, and made a discovery that comets are just a rocks traveling in space, not signs of bad omens. If this person believed in superstitions, then he would not have made such discoveries because it would have been so scary for him to look at comets. Staying neutral helped these two scientist to discover something new.\\r\\n     Let's go back to that friends-involved situation. In such a situation, most people are one-sided because there friends are involved in the situation. Therefore, people tends to overlook their friends' fault. This is staying partial rather than neutral. As a result, people often do not see the very important faults that their friends made. However, if the same situation happens to some random people, it is quite easy for others to find out all the faults. This example shows that staying neutral helps people to make better observations.\\r\\n     Staying neutral is important for every people to make better observations, discoveries, decisions, etc. People who stayed neutral made great discoveries in history. Also, unlike one-sided people, people who stay neutral have an ability to penetrate some situation as shown above.  Thus, remaining neutral helps people to make better observations and discoveries.\",\n",

For example, suppose you are in a class where everyone is lagging and sleeping. After a while, you will find yourself losing motives because everyone near you do not have motives to learn; they are lagging and sleeping. However, if you are in a class where students are very competant and working hard, you will have a motif to work hard because all students in the class are working hard.

For instance, suppose you failed on a test. After that, if you are thinking of putting more effort to get better grade next time, then you are motivating yourself to change positively. However, if you give up or does not care about such a result, then you are motivating yourself to change negatively. Perhaps, you are losing motivations to change. This example shows how our minds effects our motivation to change.\\r\\n     As shown above by two examples, environment and mind motivate people to change.

To know something secretive is especially exciting, because that gives the thrilling feeling of achievement that they know something others do not know. This is the instinct of human being that no one can resist. As the object of the curiosity is celebrity, the achievement grows, and that is why media reveals news about celebrities that is not fully confirmed.

Political parties can give the particular media merits by reforming laws, if they win any major election. Also, companies can give the media extra information that other media do not get. Such advantage is not short-lasting, but they are for centuries because laws are not changed frequently once they are reformed, and companies do not want to cause any offence of the media. If media writes something disadvantageous about one particular company, the company is out of business right away. Thus, media sometimes put uncertain news about political parties or companies to have brighter future.\\r\\n\\r\\n    Media is one group that cannot ignore in today\\'s society since it forms public opinion in democratic world.

Therefore, to live in a world that is ever changing, you must be willing to change yourself.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen you are studying history at school, you see that many events took place in your own country. In the case of my country, Korea, the land was claimed by various small nations before other big nations were established. It is natural to believe there has been a lot of changes in the way people think and live. If someone lived in an area that is important when fighting other countries, the area would be included in country A one day, and after some time it will be country B's possession. In order to live in a place like that, people had to adapt to various changes. \\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough various changes and efforts to adapt to it were made in early Korean history, after big and long lasting countries such as Lee Dynasty was established, Koreans started to live in the same way of life for a long time. Koreans grew very attached to the way their ancestors lived. That is why the development of Korean technology and diplomacy was delayed in the early 19th century. When some of the strong western nations came to Korea to trade goods, after trying a little to open the country, the heads and the people of Korea thought it was better to stick to the old patterns. In the case of Japan, although they gave up a lot of things to western nations, Japan was the first to adapt to the changes of the world and they got a lot benefits from it. They military forces developed because of the technology they accepted from advanced countries. After a while they were one of the countries that were colonizing weaker ones. Korea, because it was not open to changes, was colonized by Japan. \\r\\n\\r\\nYou could see easily how important it is to change in order to survive in the example above. Long ago, changes were slow, compared to the changes that are taking place nowadays. Changes are going to take place faster as time goes by since the whole world is connected by new communication devices and transportations. Adapting to the changes by changing yourself is more needed than ever. You have to keep in mind that without changing yourself, you will be left behind others.\",\n",

Next, flesh eating dinosaurs became extinct because they could not find herbivore dinosaurs to prey upon. Dinosaurs disappeared from the Earth because they did not change.\\r\\n  Humans will meet the same fate as dinosaurs’ if we are not willing to change.

Although conscience plays significant roles in people's lives, greed for money, fame, and power seems to surpass the power of conscience. Gatsby in the novel The Great Gatsby by Scott Fitzgerald and the parents of Tess in Tess of the D'Urbervilles illustrate the vulnerability of conscience in the face of money and power. \\r\\n     First of all, Gatsby uses unjust means to accumulate wealth. His hunger for wealth encourages him to get himself involved in the sales of alcohol during the Prohibition era. Knowing that Daisy did not marry him for his lack of wealth, Gatsby is willing to do anything to become rich. Thus, he simply ignores his inner voice that tells the immorality of engaging in illegal sales of alcohol. Furthermore, Gatsby does not seem to repent or agonize over his wrongdoings. Gatsby's conscience is powerless when encountered with his desire for money and power.\\r\\n     Another example that shows that money and power are more powerful motivators than conscience can be found in Tess of the D'Urbervilles. Joan and Jack Durbeyfields decide to send their daughter, Tess, to Alec D'Urbervilles in exchange for material wealth. Although Tess dreads being sent to D'Urbervilles and does not love him, her parents are too blinded by their love for wealth. In the midst of an abject poverty, the need for money and power precedes that for conscience and the welfare of their daughter. As a result, Tess is left miserable and hopeless to satiate her parent's desire for money. \\r\\n     Although conscience is crucial for human beings, many people seems to be motivated by the selfish greed for wealth and fame than by the truthful  voice of conscience. In the novels, The Great Gatsby and Tess of D'Urbervilles, characters who ignore their conscience can be found. Even though they fleetingly achieve what they coveted for, money and fame, they all ultimately face unhappy ends: heart-broken Gatsby is murdered while the parents of Tess have to live with the guilt of ruining their daughter's life.

There really is no way. However, if other people tell us about their thinkings to us, then we will know what kind of people we are to others.

You can also be a stranger to some people, and you can also be the most important person to some people. You can be these kinds of person to others because that is what other people think about you.

Although those who have to struggle harder might feel dejected, the final taste of triumph would be much sweeter. The joy they feel and their love for what they achieved would be incomparable. It is because people who worked hardest learn to value and cherish what they achieved. For example, when African Americans were freed from the ugly clutches of slavery, they deeply felt the values of freedom. In addition, in the epic poem The Odyssey compiled by Homer, Odysseus values home and family highly after his return from a tough journey. \\r\\n     First of all, most blacks in Southern United States during the early 19th century were stripped of their freedom by unjust slavery system: they could not educate themselves, establish a stable family, own their property, or travel by themselves. Slaves were regarded as mere objects of masters as Dred v. Scott case explicitly showed. They struggled and fought for their freedom for decades. Slave-riotings, organizing undergroud railroad, and running away from plantations are only few examples of slaves' endeavor to achieve freedom. When they ultimately gained freedom through the Emancipation Proclamation, they esteemed it highly. Immediately after the proclamation, slaves began to teach themselves and reunite with families.

There are certainly several ways to show it, and some of them are easy to follow.\\r\\n\\r\\n    The best way to show anger appropriately is to stare at the person with your mouth shut firmly. At the same time, put strength on the face, so the face will look strong and stubborn. From that facial expression, people will catch that the person is angry, but he or she is trying to restrain it for the sake of the other person. This is effective because it shows the determination of the person that he or she is angry, but at the same time, it shows the ristricting side of the person. Both are opposite characteristic, but by existing on the face at the same time, it creates mysterious atmosphere, which raises the angry person's position. Then, the other person will be easily subdued. This can be used with anyone, no matter how old, high-ranked, or strong he or she is.\\r\\n\\r\\n    The other way is to put hands on the waist, stare at the person, and bite the lower lip. By doing this, it gives authority to the person who is taking this action, as a mother usually do to scold a child. However, it can be used in daily life with other people. The hands on the waist shows the authority, staring shows the anger itself, and the biting of lower lip shows the degree of anger. Biting lip slightly means a person is angered slightly, and biting lip strongly means he or she is furious. Thus, this way not only shows that the person is angry, but it also shows the degree of anger, thus making others act according to it.\\r\\n\\r\\n    Anger is not easy to control, but it is easy to show. The problem is the appropriateness of the expression. Of course, there are several fine ways to show anger, and 2 of them are to stare at the person with firm countenance, and to put hands on the waist, stare at the person, and bith lower lip according to the degree of the anger.

Since soldiers were killed during the war, many people think that combats caused such a big number of death. However, according to statistics, more people were killed by diesases than in combats. Same thing happened during the First World War; more people were killed by diseases rather than in combats. The interesting fact is that slight wounds made people to get infacted and caused them to die. However, this is not true for us. We do not see people dying from a single wound. In addition, we can now cure diseases that were once impossible to treat. Thus, nowadays, people usually do not have to suffer from diseases, and people can live happily. Since these kinds of treatments are available to more and more people in the world, the world is changing for the better.\\r\\n     If development of medicine made the world better by making people to suffer less, development of underwater cables made the world better because they allow people to communicate with people who live long distance away. For instance, when I study in U.S., I always keep contact with my family and friends, who live in Korea, by using phone and internet because they are fast, and they allow me to listen to their voices. Life will be very miserable for me if I am unable to communicate with my family and friends. However, I do not have to worry about not being able to communicate with my family and friends because underwater cables allow me to call overseas and send mails over seas. Development of underwater cables made my life better. As a result, I see the world changing for the better.\\r\\n     As shown in two examples above, people's lives are getting better and better. Medicines made people to suffer less, and underwater cables made people possible to communicate over long distance in very short time. All of these changes make our lives better.

In this case doctors are like a machine which cannot decide itself, so they should not prosecute doctors for doing that. People cannot blame car after crashing into a pole on the side of the street, which is due to their careless driving. With similar logic, people cannot blame doctors for aiding patients for their commiting suicide, because doctors are \"being used.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n    Terminally ill people have unknown emotional pain inside their heart, and that is unparalled one.

In the movie <Matrix>, Oracle, the mentor of Neo, says to Neo, the protagonist of movie, that \"Choice is yours.\" In other word, she means that choice comes from oneself, not by others.

Policemen get shot at, even paramedics and doctors who treat AIDS. Astronauts could blow up or be lost in space. The writer who wrote satanic verse had courage. They put a price on his head. Hiding everyday, not knowing if the next stranger on the street is going to kill you because of that which you wote. Gettin gout of bed in the morning takes courage if you're in his shoes.\\r\\n\\r\\n  And school teaches you that scientists also are brave when people don't believe their ideas but they stick to their guns and history proves them right.

Other examples of courage are a fighter pilot behind enemy lines and the person who fights off a mugging. I think that all these examples prove that fear doesn't.\",\n",

In the 1950s, women still faced enormous obstacles in society; they received much less pay than men, many companies refused to hire women, and the \"glass ceilings\" were always present. Thus, many women could not venture into the real world and had to stay home and do house chores. As time passed, women’s discontent with their conditions mounted. They could no longer tolerate the community\\'s prejudice against them. In 1970s, in a spur of moment, women began to actively advocate for their causes. They organized demonstrations and the Women\\'s Rights Movement was galvanized. Through their endeavor, they brought numerous changes; they gained the right for abortion and were guaranteed prominent seats as government officers. For example, Sandra O\\' Connor became the first woman jury in the court. Women\\'s determination to improve their bleak situations fostered great changes that would affect even today\\'s women. \\r\\n     Desire to bring justice is another essential factor that motivates people to change. Before the outbreak of the Civil War, Southerners maintained a cruel slavery system. Most Northerners disapproved such outright violation of human\\'s rights and exploitation of labor; they felt that slavery was an unjustifiable institution that needs to be eliminated. Thus, although most Northerners were not directly influenced by slavery, they followed their moral virtues and waged the war against the Southerners.\\r\\n     Humans have gone through countless changes centuries. All changes took place because they were motivated by the willingness and desire of its people. Thus, people must not fear changes because they are the representative of humans\\' inner voices.',\n",

Rather, personal development is another strong reason for attending college. I can offer several specific reasons to support my beliefs.\\r\\n\\r\\n   Fist, I believe that many, if not most, people attend college because the want to prepare themselves for the job market. Today, many of the best paying jobs require a college education. For example, a person cannot become a lawyer or a medical doctor without a college education. A college education allows people who are interested in such fields to learn from experiecned educators. It also gives college students the opportunity to learn in an educational setting before the apply their knowledge in situations that can have long-term real-world effects.\\r\\n\\r\\n  I also believe that many people attend college for personal development.  A college education requires students to take courses outside of their field of interest. For example, most colleges require that all students take general education courses in government, geography and liberal studies. The purpose of such requirements is to prepare all students to be interested and informed citizens. Students also participate in study abroad programs or social and political organizations to learn more about themselves and the world they live in. \\r\\n\\r\\n  A college education is much more than a job-training course.

When we observe our parents we can know ourselves more. Our friends also tell us about ourselves. \\r\\n  When we look at our parents, we can know more about ourselves. Most people spend significant part of their lives with their parents. When people spend their time together for a long time, they become similar. Especially children are more prone to influence from outside. We can easily observe from our experience that cubs of animals are easier to train than fully grown up animals. We can assume from this observation that children are likely to be more affected by people around them. Thus, influence of parents on their children cannot be discarded easily. Moreover, for this reason, many children adopt parts of traits and personalities of their parents. I read a story about a child who hit his classmates for no reason. His teachers wanted to teach him not to do it but he became worse and worse. Later they found out that his father had come home late and beat the poor child everyday. That child learned that trait from his father and applied it to his classmates. By looking at parents we can learn many things about their children. It applies to us in the same way. When we watch our parents carefully, we can learn more about our traits and characteristics.\\r\\n  We can learn about ourselves from our friends too. There is an old saying, “Birds of a feather flock together” We can infer from this proverb that friends share certain traits.

When we start playing soccer and rain starts pouring down, we do not stop can keep playing on. Thus, when we observe our friends we can know more about ourselves.\\r\\n  We often find it difficult to find out what kind of people we actually are.

From historical and modern figures we can see that every obstacle is indeed an opportunity.\\r\\n\\tWhenever a society faces a difficulty such as trade hardships or an epidemic disease, which seem to cloud its future history has proved that the society is likely to overcome the difficulties and open a new future. During the seventeenth century Great Britain and other European nations faced a trade blockade by the Arabian merchants stopping them from gaining direct profits from Indian trade. As a substitute the Europeans, unconscious about the existence of the American continent, invested to discover the passage to India by traveling through the Atlantic Ocean to avoid the Arabian merchants. Seeking for a passageway to India, they found the newfound land, in other wise, America, and were able to profit from growing colonies of plantation and extracting from them.

Usually known as the initiator of democratic government, Great Britain has been successful at slowly including the normal people into the aristocratic politics of the time.

However, the government wishes to encroach its power over people and exploit the freedom through censorships. Censorship is an unjustifiable violation of people\\'s right to express themselves and their right to learn the truths. \\r\\n     Censorship, most of all, curtails people\\'s freedom to express their ideas through books, music, and other media. In George Orwell’s novel 1984, everything is censored. If a person writes or expresses thoughts that do not fit the expectation of the Big Brother\\'s Society, he/she is doomed to get tortured by the government agency. Every writer and news reporters has to write what the fearful government orders them to. Society depicted in the novel is the manifestation of outright tyranny of government; gloom and dim atmosphere surrounds society and people live lives comparable to that of zombie. If the government gradually exercise its controls over what people think by censorship, society would be soon \"dead\" like that of 1984. \\r\\n     Another aspect of censorship that is unjustifiable is that it can be used to deceive people by veiling the truths. During the Vietnam War, many government officers did not wish to media to display pictures and video clips from the war sites. Although the government continuously assured people that the United States was winning the war, the pictures from Vietnam clearly revealed the truth: the country was very far from acquiring the victory. Shocked and aghast after seeing uncensored materials from the war, people withdrew their support for war and displayed anger toward government for giving them false hope and misguided information. If everything from the Vietnam War was censored, as the government once wished, Americans would have been oblivious and blind to the stark truths. \\r\\n     Censorship, whether it was meant as benefit or as harm, is an unjustifiable act because it prohibits the rights to express and rights to know truths. In today\\'s democratic society, people can control themselves without government\\'s surveillance and encroachment.

Like Japanese executives, a boss should be able to take all responsibility if his or her team fails a project. Also, responsibility has been the most important virtue of leaders throughout the history of China, Korea, and Japan for thousands of years. That is why East Asian people blame leaders who do not take blames for what they have done wrong. Thus, bosses have to take responsibility as leaders because in other words, that proves them to be real bosses.\\r\\n    Boss apparently needs responsibility in their career, but they also need generosity that is required for forgiving his co-workers and workers who do jobs for them. This idea of generosity is helpful in many ways, but the greatest help is in having support from his co-workers. By forgiving their co-workers, co-workers owe something to them and later it will be paid back. People remember a person who did kind things to them, and people pay it back in some form, whether it is just a sentence of regard, or an action of assistance. Not only that, generosity helps bosses get more respect from their co-workers, which means that his companions will look up to him and be willing to do whatever he/she asks to do. Such advantages can be achieved from having generosity and therefore I choose this to be the essential characteristic of boss.\\r\\n    Being a boss or a leader is not an easy job for everyone and it surely has some prerequisites.

When I was in my second year of junior high school, I was preparing for the National Mathematics competition. At first when I started the preparation, all my teachers told me to consider this preparation as a good experience for it would be hard to receive a good award within only a year. At first, my mock test results were nothing more than abysmal, however, I learnt to be patient and studied calmly for the test. I reviewed my notes again and again and went over the difficult questions with perseverance. After the national competition took place, nobody expected me to win a prize. However, when the results came out, I was awarded the Honor Award. Everybody, acclaimed my effort, but I knew that it was not my effort which did the job, it was my patience which took me through the preparation period. It is not a genius or an innate gift, which makes it possible for a person to achieve a miracle; it is patience, which helps him/her to accomplish the miracle.\\r\\n\\t\\r\\n\\tFriendship is something that lasts for a lifetime and rescues you in a time of hardship and it is ever so evident that a true friendship cannot be won over a few days or months. When I first arrived at Korea on my fifth grade, I have met a girl named In Jung. As a newcomer I was unfamiliar to anything in our school and rather intimidated, it was then In Jung helped me out in many situations, however, as time passed and we grew in a real friend (not a guide and a foreigner relationship) we had fights and troubles, there were even time when we felt that our relation could not last a minute longer. Nonetheless, every time, we learnt to be patient and listen to the other one’s reasons and thoughts. Five years have passed since we met, and now, we are best friends who are like a pine tree, always standing there for each other. I do not doubt that patience was the key to our long and affable relation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tThrough out my life, there have been many challenges and every time a hardship approached me, patience was the answer to the question or the dilemma. Last summer, I was climbing Mt AnnaPurna of the Himalayan range, as it was the rainy season, the rain was dropping all over me and made it more difficult to climb. However, at that situation, I said to myself once again, ‘patience is the answer, be patient my girl.’ And, I was able to reach the ABC (AnnaPurna Base Camp).',\n",

Since the Middle Age, a great gap existed between commoners and aristocrats. Nobles thought that they were superior to peasants. Nobles made peasants pay taxes so that they could keep on living extravagantly. On the other hand, farmers paid too much tax that they had to starve during the winter. Commoners of French could not stand this injustice so that they started protesting. They stormed into Bastille which was notorious for imprisoning so many people. Furthermore, they killed King Louis the Sixteenth. French started Republic and the social injustice gradually disappeared. This could happen because French people wanted to change their way of living.\\r\\n  Moreover, Industrial Revolution also started due to people who wanted to live more comfortably. For instance, James Watts constantly sought a way to change how people live and finally invented a cooling device for a steam engine. After this device was invented, people began to use steam engines more and more. This marked the beginning of the era of Industrial Revolution.

When the Puritans first arrived in the New Land, they wished to escape the brutal and ongoing persecution from the Church of England; they believed that the Church was in urgent need of reform for its intolerance and dogmatic doctrines. However, nit is very paradoxical that Puritans themselves were never tolerant of people with different beliefs and backgrounds; they stoned many Quakers to death, burned women accused of being witches in events such as Salem Witch Trails, and stigmatized Catholics. In Nathaniel Hawthorne’s novel The Scarlet Letter, the intolerance and provincial views of Puritans’ society is vividly depicted.

Douglass asserted that although white Americans seem to value freedom and regard those who suppress such freedom with hatred and disbelief, they acted in such ways because they were culpable of the same deed. On the fourth of July, Frederick Douglass was invited to the meeting of white men to make a speech that commemorates the Independence Day. Instead, he used the event as an opportunity to comment that white Americans were not the protectors of freedom as long as they maintained the slavery system.

The French volunteered for the army, supported their soldiers, and most importantly, believed with certainty that they could win the war. The French found the way to get out of the war, and they apparently took the way. This was all possible to them because they acknowledged the power of hope, and this war is surely the perfect showcase of the saying given.\\r\\n\\r\\n    People should never give up their hope, because even though the situation may not seem good and bright, there is always the way to solve it. Like the Hundred Yeras\\'  War, the French realized the strength of hope and the saying, and the result is obvious.

The greatest griefs are those we cause ourselves in most times. Many evidences from literature, cinema, and history show individuals that how people were collapsed by mistakes they made.\\r\\n\\tConsider Creon, the antagonist of Antigone, the play of ancient greek writer, Sopochles. Creon imprisoned Antigone because she buried her brother's corpse against Creon's order. If he just forgave his niece and tried to understand why she did it, the tragedy would not occur. However, Creon was too stubborn to overrule his decision, therefore, he ended up losing not just Antigone, but also his son and wife who committed suicide after Antigone's death. It was possible for him to make a different choice and better consequence, but his obstinacy led him to the tragedy.\\r\\n\\tSalier, who was best known as the rival of Mozart, also demonstrated that people produce great sorrow by themselves. He was a respected royal composer, and his operas were loved by many audiences. However, Salier was possessed by inferiority complex toward Mozart for his whole life, and he became a target of universal derision because of  disturbances and slanders he made to tear Mozart down. If Salier was satisfied with his quality, he would not remain as the symbol of untalented person, and more importantly, he could live a better life.\\r\\n\\tThe greatest sorrow that caused by oneself is also found in movies. In Waterloo Bridge, Myra gave up her life and became prostitute when she heard the news that her fiance died in the battle. But when she went to the port to find customers, she saw her fiance, who have just arrived. If she did not abandon herself, she could live happily with her fiance. Instead, she realized that she was not qualified for him anymore, and threw herself into the ocean. The movie shows that how one's stupid choice lead one to the irrevocable result.\\r\\n\\tExamples from various sources cleary show that people are agonized by the sorrows made by themselves in most of times. Creon, Sailer, and Myra, they were all in distress by the choice they had made. The greatest griefs are those we cause ourselves.\",\n",

       " ('People appreciate anything like music, car, or even novel that gives them peace in their mind. What people appreciate without any prejudice is music, which is the basic form of expressing abstract feelings and minds. Music has been existed for at least more than 5000 years, helping people create the atmosphere in the ceremony, festival, or war. Music helps human beings express their feelings with colors and decorations, and also, it promotes people’s efficiency in work and it helps people through countless situations.\\r\\n\\tWhat music does in our mind is very obvious. Music creates variety of emotions in human beings’ mind and leads them to follow what those feelings say. The most effective music in work place is called MUSAC, the background music in the workplace or any public place where people require some form of concentration in mind. This form of music creates “mental enzyme” in human mind and thus assists people to do better, do more, and do faster on their job. Not only that can be an example of the power of music, but also many other kind of music like classical music can do the same thing with people. When someone listens to the national anthem of the United States, Star Spangled Banner, they would feel patriotism and bravery in their mind. Also, if someone listens to Beethoven’s symphony number 5, they would sense the misery, hopelessness, and the power of fate at first, but later people would have the idea of liveliness that overcoming the misery. Like this, music is very strong method of evoking the innermost feelings, and sometimes the instinct that causes people to overthrow their superego.\\r\\n\\tPrenatal care is now a very serious business, because parents want their child to be smart, generous, and benevolent. To those parents, “Mozart effect” is not unfamiliar term. “Mozart effect” is a theory that exclaims the music of Mozart is beneficial to child’s intellectual development as those babies grow up. Even though this theory is not yet sure to be trusted, it certainly shows the power of music to human beings. Similar one is “Bach effect,” which says that the music of Bach is helpful to child’s development of E.Q., known as Emotional Quotient. This “Bach effect” is known to develop infants’ emotional side, and thus, make them more like human being than a cold-blooded person. Music also tranquilizes excited feelings, or vice versa, and that depends on the situation. Good example is Dvorak’s symphony number 9, and it excites people by expressing the composer’s cultural shock in America. Certainly, from every aspect, music is actually the strongest invention of humanity.\\r\\n\\tPeople have long been using music as their companion of life that relieves their sorrow, anger and tiredness. Music is often used in mental therapy or at the workplace to boost people’s outcomes. Always, the power of music has soothed us, excited us, doomed us, and relieved us, and it will always do the same job.',\n",

Taj Mahal, Crime and Punishment, and people having Pericles syndrome provide the evidences that sometimes things that seem clear and simple can become ambiguous and complicated.\\r\\n\\tWhen the king of India decided to build Taj Mahal, all he wanted was to pray for the repose of his wife's departed soul. However, the construction for 22 years led to downfall of economy andmany people died out. People who supposed to be in their work place had to build Taj Mahal, instead of farming or making goods. In the end, the people who were mad at the king impeached and banished him . The plan for Taj Mahal was originated from the king's excessive love for his dead wife, but his innocent intention caused many people's death and fall of the national economy.\\r\\n\\tThe example is also found in literature. In Crime and Punishment, Raskolinikov decided to murder the corrupted pawnbroker, because he believed it was his mission, and he thought he was killing an ideology rather than a real person. However, he accidentally killed pawnbroker's sister too. This unintentional murder tormented him with remorse, and Raskolinikov determined to confess in the end. Murder was not a big deal for him because he was not conscious of killing the actual person, but it suddenly turned out to be an unforgivable sin.\\r\\n\\tThose who fall into Pericles syndrome are also applicable to the statement. They think they can purify all the injustice only if they hold an authority. Hence they conspired with iniquitous device and choose exessively unjust way to be successful. However. usually their dishonest take the length of their foot and lead them to downfall.   Even though people who fell into Pericles syndrome had pure motivation from first, the unjust methods they chose cause intricate result. \\r\\n\\tIt is important to have patent motivation because it will make one's procedure clear and simple. However,  usually simple plans do not turn out as well as one thought, because there are more holes and traps than the plans with deliberation. No matter how one's purpose is clear, if it lacks consideration, it easily ruins  the original purpose, and make things ambiguous.\",\n",

Darwin is an excellent example who had to bear the ridicule  and contempt of ignorant society. Because his idea of evolution was too innovative and agaist the Bible, it was hardly acccepted by the people who lived in same period. Without genetic information, people thought his idea was absurd and out of blue. Therefore, he had to wait until the world developed fully enough to reinvestigate and prove he was right. \\r\\n\\tEvidence is also found in literature. In Zola's An Apus, Clode was held in derision of the spectators of salon because of his bold style of painting. However, in the end, Clode is acknowledged by after ages and in reverse, illiterate audiences are jeered. Edouard Manet, the real model for Clode, also went through same hardships as Clode did.\\r\\n\\tMorever, sometimes people feel jealous of great people and strain for finding vices and tearing them down. For example, Baslav Nijinski, the most famous danseur in the ballet history, brought tremendous devlopement to ballet. Young generation enthused about him and his innovative productions. However conservative audiences were angry about his plays and censured that he was superficial and he only pursued sensations. Moreover, people mocked his physical shortcomings such as short height and weird accent despite his dances. In the end, Nijinski obtained mental desease because of stress and ended up his life in a  psychiatric ward. He could dance on the stage for only 10 years, and rest of his life was destroyed by naive audiences.\\r\\n\\tExamples from history and literature clearly show that one's greatness can lead people to misconception. Although one might struggle hard until he is recognized as great, one's efforts are easily forgotten and oppressed by ignorant, naive society\",\n",

This anecdote emphasizes the importance of change by showing the two consequences for those who choose change and for those who deny change. Of course, the survivors were those who chose change. Likewise, change is essential to survive and if one denies change he/she may lose many things such as property and even life. Holden survived from the harsh world because he accepted changes. However, Royalists denied the change of their world and the consequences of denying the change was harsh\\r\\n  First, people who choose the change can survive, just as Holden’s case. Holden is the main character of novel The Catcher in the Rye, by J.D. Salinger. Holden suffered from the dilemma of becoming an adult. Becoming an adult was extremely harsh to him. Life as an adult was full of unacceptable and pessimistic things. However, by roaming New York City, he realized that becoming an adult was unavoidable and finally, he accepted the change. Because he was fully grown and changed, at the end of the novel, Holden became an adult and was able to cope with the harsh society. Likewise, many people meet with the necessity of change through life, and obviously only those who willing to change can survive.\\r\\n  Second, people who deny the change loose many things through their life, as the Royalists. The Royalists are a group of people in America who sustained their royalty to England in the 18th century. During the 17th century, there was the American Independence War. However, a lot of Royalists in America denied the new country and sustained their royalty to England. Because they denied the new world, after America gained its independence they were tortured and blamed by Americans. Also, after the war, England denied them. If they had realized the reality of the situation and had changed themselves, there wouldn’t have been such a tragic end for them. Obviously, the world is harsh for those who deny the change.\\r\\n  It is said, \"Take pleasure to change.\" This means that the change is unavoidable, so be willing to change. Indeed the man, who changes, like Holden, survives and the men who deny the changes, like Royalists, fail. The 21st century, “era of information,” changes extremely fast. For example, every three days, new models of mobile phones are invented. So to survive in this fast-paced world, change is unavoidable. It\\'s better to be willing to change.',\n",

Although Albert Einstein did not succeed, he had more free time than other people who had jobs. At the age of 20, using his free time effectively, Einstein developed the basis for the Theory of Relativity. Due to this theory, he could later become a world-famous scientist.

Furthermore, in despotic countries such as North Korea, the dictator uses media to control common people.\\r\\n  Media did not show much responsibility in respect to Professor Hwang’s incident. It kept on reporting news that would attract and excite people.

Many people were disappointed and they started blaming Mr. Hwang for committing such an atrocity, which was deceiving nearly everybody in Korea.

Teenagers are very well acquainted with the Internet surfing, and they can find what they want in less than 10 minutes. However, the effect of surfing the net is not more beneficial than harmful nowadays. The serious crime rate of teenagers are increasing, and that is mainly due to the Internet.\\r\\n\\r\\n    About 3 decades ago, teenagers were afraid of absconding from their home, because of the unknown world outside. Nowadays, however, adolescents are not afraid to do so because they have more information about the outside world than their parents' generation. This is due to the Internet, and surely, surfing the net is drawing teenagers into harm. The evidence for that is the increase of the rate of teenage crime. The serious crime committed by adolescents in Korea has sored 75 percent compared to a decade ago. 10 years ago, Korea had few homes which had the Internet service in their residence. That means after the popularization of the Internet, youths began to commit more crimes.\\r\\n\\r\\n    According to the survey, also, when those teens who committed serious crimes were caught, they tell the officer that they learned it while they were surfing the net. This is the main reason of the opinion of surfing the net is harmful. Of course, youths have immature thinking process, and they are yet impulsive. Through that period, they are contacted with the Internet, and they find something that stimulates their instinct, like crimes or drugs. The rate of the crime-committed youths who were influenced by the Internet are much higher than the ones who were not influenced.

Like the ancients said, getting to know oneself seems to be the most difficult task of life. Although some people disagree to the quote ‘The more we learn about other people, the more we learn about ourselves’ I believe that this quote clearly states the most common and recommendable method of learning oneself. By an example from the literature masterpiece Pride and Prejudice and my own personal episode, this quote will be proved.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tFirst, it is commonly know that a person is inclined to develop a prejudice about certain type based on his/her social backgrounds and personal experiences and learning about others can help one to find one’s prejudices that he/she did not know. ‘At first sight I saw your pride, your sense of superiority over others and your arrogance’ said Elizabeth to Mr. Darcy when he proposed to her. Growing up in a well to do family in the country, Jane has certain prejudices about Mr. Darcy, a wealthy Londoner with respectable backgrounds, due to his manners. However, after she accuses Mr. Darcy wrongly for her sister and friend’s unhappiness and receives his letter of apology and explanation, she starts to realize that many she was being quite unfair to Mr. Darcy. After a while, seeing Mr. Darcy’s humanly sides, although rather smoothened after Elizabeth’s disapproval, Elizabeth realized that she had been prejudiced against Mr. Darcy. It was then when Elizabeth become conscious of her stereotypes and prejudices. Everyone is liable to a certain injustice and learning about other people sometimes reveals this part of you that you did not know.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tSecondly, even when you look at a mirror the reflection does not show you as you are; right and left is switched vice versa, however through the acts of other people and what you think about it reflects what kind of a person you are. Currently I am attending a boarding school and at here you get to spend the whole day with an extremely restricted number of people, giving me a lot of chance to examine individuals. One of my close friends is one of those people who mourn over everything without giving it the slightest try. Every time she sulked, I would be very harsh on her; afterwards, my friends would tell me that I seem to be a person of a great discipline. I have never knew that I was strict person but every since I was young it seemed obvious to me that the obligations were there to be done and there are certain things that I have to do for myself. If I did not meet my sulky friend, I would not have known my one of my most evident characteristic.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tFully realizing oneself has been the ultimate goal for many wise men, saints and great teachers and still proves to be one of the most difficult tasks for a person. However, more we interact and learn about others we are capable of learning our shortcomings, prejudices and strengths. The sea does not know what lives inside it until somebody comes up and looks into it and tells the pond about the fishes, crabs, whales and other great many creatures in it. And I believe it is same for the people also, you won’t know what’s inside of yourself until somebody give the trigger.',\n",

However, I believe that the mistakes are necessary and withour any mistakes, a person usually makes nothing at all.\\r\\n   Person without any mistakes usually has arrogance and think him/herself perfect so that later he/she makes crucial mistakes in their work and makes nothing at all. It is represented in my observerance of other person, my brother. He was a great pianist from his early age. From the start of his playing the piano, he has made no mistakes in his learning, and become proud of himself. His proud has become arrogance little by little, and finally became to think that he is perfect at playing the piano. From then, he practiced very little, even when facing the piano contest. However, in contest, the lack of practice was well-observed, and he got no prize. As seen from my brother's example, a person without mistakes makes nothing at all.\\r\\n   Not only in my brother's example, but also in my experience, the fact that a person who makes no mistakes usually makes nothing at all is shown. From elementary school, I always had been the top at the study in my school. I never had had mistakes in my exam, and my score always had been good. Similar to my brother, I became arrogant myself. However, in high school entrance exam, I had a crucial mistake.  I did not check the whole questions, and made no answer for many questions. Because I was always perfect at my exam, I did not confirm my test paper, and finally, failed in exam. Although I made no mistake before, later, I made nothing.\\r\\n   In conclusion, a person who makes no mistakes usually makes nothing at all. Even if he/she has been good before and made no mistake before, he/she would finally make nothing. This is well observed in my brother's example, and my experience. Consequently, I am sure that the mistake is necessary.\",\n",

Everyone would steal one another's possession and no one will work hard to possess something unless it is protected. Intellectual property playes an important role in society and it is as valuable as material property. Therefore it should be protected like material property. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe reason why socialism failed is that it does not give people freedom to have what they earned. As Adam Smith said in his book Wealth of Nations, a society as a whole is better off because people seek their own well-being. Socialism does not let people possess things. People do not have desire to work because no matter how hard they work, their gains are taken away. I think is works the same for intellectual property. \\r\\n\\r\\nFor example, let's say J.K Rowling is now writing her 7th book of the Harry Potter series. She thinks her right as an author will be protected under the law, so she keeps on writing her book. If Rowling thinks her 7th book will be stolen and that the book will be published with someone else's name on it, she will not write her book. I think everyone who made a discovery in science, wrote a book or has any other kind of intellectual property of their own would react the same way Rowling in the example would if their property was not protected.   \\r\\n\\r\\nScientific discoveries that cure human disease, discoveries of knowledge in many fields, and great writings are all intellectual properties that are crucial for everyone in the world. If the ones who produce it stops working, it will stop the progress of human knowledge and enlightenment. Therefore I think intellectual property should definately be protected under the law.\",\n",

This unconquerable enemy is very much a threat to humanities, but fortunately, human beings have developed several methods to relieve stress, reassuring the place of the “Lord of the animals.” Some of them are even more effective than drugs pharmacists and medical companies sell on the markets, hoping people to buy some of them.\\r\\n    The best way to relieve stress is to listen to music they like the most, since music has its own power to promote people’s saddened feeling. This is not scientifically unproven, because when people listen to their favorite music, they tend to sooth themselves. Whatever the genre of their favorite music is, let them have their private time to concentrate their senses to it, and fight vigorously against stress. When they listen to music, they let music take over their body, and their body takes rhythm all of a sudden. Music has been the initial form of expressing feeling and emotion and that makes people feel the same way as the musician does while they play. This makes people forget about their own problem, but they just flow like a powerless leaf riding a stream with no resistance at all. Then, people forget why they were angry, sad, or depressed, and that leads them to relieve their stress.\\r\\n    People usually exercise much to build their body at least like someone who seems to be strong. However, exercise also has the advantage in relieving stress, to our surprise, and this is very crucial since modern humanities are suffering greatly from this. Why this exercise is helpful is biological: when people exercise, they have this hormone called adrenalin that boosts people’s body muscle and nerve system to be more active than ever before. This helps people get over with their hardships, because the body system is sometimes complicated, and yet very simple when it comes to fighting against unwilling things that invade our body. It is very much needed in this system that something assists the defense system, and that is adrenalin in our body. \\r\\n    This is very important issue, which we all should fight against stress, and this surely has to be put first in every matter. Therefore, people should have their own remedy to cure this scolded curse of humanities. I would recommend listening to music, and exercise, the basic forms of stress-busting system.',\n",

Learning about how nature works means learning about the nature as natural science or learning about the nature of social science. The classes that I take in college will teach me both things.

However, if we consider some experiences in our lives with other animals, we can see that other animals also feel pain, happiness and love. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe see dogs howl when people hit them. They feel pain. We can deduce that animals have feelings of love when we see the mothers that have young care for them. Many animals fight to death to save their young. When dogs are taken away one of their young and get their young back later, as I have observed, they are overjoyed. They lick the young that came back and roll on the floor with their young. Then what is the difference between humans and other animals? Some people say we are the only ones who think, but before becoming a pig or a cat we do not know and we cannot prove whether they can think or not.  \\r\\n\\r\\nI think the difference lies in that we are human, and that we try to justify our dominance and killings of other animals because being human we need to place priorities to live on humans. I do not think a girl should be sacrificed to make  a hundred lions live. Most people think the same way I do. In order to live, we need to eat, and to eat we need to sacrifice other animals. However, it does not mean that we can treat animals like some furniture like property that can be thrown away or burned. The animals have the right to live in good conditions for them, and the right to be treated like we treat eachother when they are living.

Cigarettes cause serious illness such as cancer. To me, therefore, cigarettes should be made illegal for the sake of people's health.\\r\\n\\r\\n    Health is one of the most important thing for a human being, because without it, they cannot achieve anything. Thus, I denounce things that are harmful to health, and one of them is cigarette. That is why I believe cegarettes should be illegal. Cigarettes contain deadly chemicals, and some of them are tar and nicotin. Tar is famous for its carcinogenic chemical inside in it, that causes lung cancer. As smokers inhale the smoke, tar goes into the smoker's lung and cling to it. Then the chemical starts to break into lung cell, and then develop cancer. Also, when tar sticks on lung, it blocks the bronchial tube also, and cause bronchitis. Another deadly chemical is nicotin, and it is the main cause of addiction to cigarette. It also works in blood vessel, either blocking it or narrowing it. Thus, after smoking, smokers' body temperature drops about 1 to 3 degrees, and that is fatal. Also, smokers after smoking has higher percentage of cerebral hemorrhage because of narrow blood vessel. This is why I believe cigarettes should be illegal.\\r\\n\\r\\n    Non-smokers, also, have the same problem with smokers when it comes to health. If non-smokers are within the range of 5 meters of smokers who are smoking, the serious health problems happen to them also. Especially when non-smokers are exposed to the cigarette smoke for a long period of time, the trouble becomes bigger. If a smoker is a family, and he or she smokes more than half a box a day in the house, then the other family members who do not smoke have higher risk of cancer and other cigarette-related illness than the smoker. This is critical because smokers are not just ruining their own health, but they are also ruining their family, and even someone they do not even know well. Cigarette is killing people who are unrelated to it, and that is something that should not be overlooked. Cigarette is causing problem that no one can take the whole responsibility, and hence, cigarettes must be made an illicit item.\\r\\n\\r\\n    Cigarettes are something that ruin humanity by ruining people's healthy bodies. With toxic chemicals, cigarettes threaten people's lives. They also threaten non-smokers, not to mention smokers. It is very serious problem, and in my opinion, this problem will be solved only by outlawing cigarettes. Something that causes devastating result should be illegal, and cigarettes are obviously in that category.\",\n",

However, nowadays the parents who let their children be what they want to be are increasing. The reason for this is the infinite competition of this world. The development of the internet and transportation has made it easier for people to communicate. It made doctors share medical information, scientists share research, and writers read eachother's novels with ease. A person from Korea can be a doctor in the US. Someone from America can get a sugery in France. In the society of medical doctors, the competition is increasing. Because of the competition, the job doctor is not a stable, forever well paying job. You have to keep researching and look for new machines that can help your patients in order to be a doctor who gets paid. \\r\\n\\r\\nOn the other hand, the jobs that were once undesirable to many have become good sources of income for the  successful in those fields.

New media that is based upon digital technology is taking place of traditional media that relies on paper and alphabet.

However, by doing so, people take copyrighted work of someone, and use that as if the work belongs to them. There is copyright law to prevent such phenomenon, but on the Internet, to trace down someone visiting a particular website is harder than finding a needle in hay. Thus, this new media has a problem with copyright law. Actually, thousands of treatise are used without any permission, which is against the law, and thousands of pirated movies, comic books, and novels are on the Internet. This shows that traditional copyright law is not suitable for digital media.\\r\\n\\r\\n    To people, protecting privacy and personal property has been the most important thing for thousands of years.

Filtering out the inappropriate things for the bulb, he could reach to appropriate material. He became a successful man thanks to his failures.\\r\\n  On the other hand, historical event also shows that the failure can sow the seeds of success. The war between ancient Rome and Carthage, called 'Punic War', shows that failure is basis for the success. Ancient Rome, a strong nation, always lost to Carthage in the war between navies. However, the defeat from Carthage teached Rome the reason of defeat, and caused Rome to win finally. \\r\\n   In conclusion, failure can sow the seeds of success.

Rather I believe that the innovation leads to the change of the world, making people attempt to adapt to this change.\\r\\n    The history well-shows this fact that the innovation leads to the change, and the attempt to adapt. When the industrial revolution started, people were not familiar to this innovation. Before the revolution, people only had thought of hand-made products. However, the industrial revolution changed the whole world. It made machines that can produce products massively, that people's hands were not needed anymore. It made people at that time who only used their hands extremely poor. As a result of this, people had to adapt to this change. They had to work in the factory, where they did not made product directly, but only aided machines to work well.  So, innovation led to the change of the world, and led to the attempt to adapt.\\r\\n   Also, in modern society, it is well shown that the innovation is the subject of the change that makes people try to adapt. Invention of the car is one example. Invention of car was so surprising and pleasing event to people. It made possible for people to move far conviniently. The convinience of the car attracted the people, and so many people in the world became to have their own car. This made the great change of the world because it quickly led to the industrialized society. However, adaption was needed. People had to learn how to ride their cars. To ride the cars, they had to get liscenses allowing the ride. Also in this case, innovation led to the change, and made people try to adapt.\\r\\n   In conclusion, contrary to many people's beliefs, innovation drives to people's attempt to adapt to a changing world. Two examples above, -industrial revolution and the invention of the car- prove this fact. So, I believe that rather than just adapting to a change, people have to 'innovate' somethings.\",\n",

Some people kill others everyday, and some of them are put in jail, or sentenced to death. This death sentence has been existed at least for more than 5,000 years. In Hammurabi Code, someone committed murder must be killed. That tradition passed down from generation to generation, and we still see this in modern constitutions, although it is modified. Judges still give death sentence to some criminals who committed unspeakable crimes. This long lasting history of death penalty shows that it has self-proven the efficiency, and death penalty is efficient for the prohibitoin of heinous crimes.\\r\\n\\r\\n    People who faced death in their lives, but miraculously survived recalls later that the event changed their lifestyles. This is because death is something shocking, devastating, and frightening. These characteristics of death is used in law, and that is why there is death penalty. People know there will be death penalty if they commit murder, and they have second mind about what they were going to do. People who almost committed serious crime say that the death penalty reminded them to be rational. They say being rational right before the crime saved their lives from falling into abyss, and that can also mean death penalty can reduce serous crimes.\\r\\n\\r\\n    Death penalty is something fatal, literally. It takes away someone's life in unnatural way. However, because there is death sentence, thousands of people are saved from being murdered. By using the instinctive fear of death, death penalty is very helpful in reducing heinous crime rate, and they are especially effective in reducing murder rate.

This can be seen in everyday life, literature, and even age-old history, making it the ultimately inevitable human characteristic.\\r\\n   In everyday life we see people making mistakes. Even people like Thomas Edison made mistakes, thinking that he had made a workable plan for the lightbulb for over 5,000 mistakes. Isaac Newton, the founder of modern physics had fundamental flaws in his theories that he didn't know about. Just like that, however smart or famous, respected the person is doesn't matter when counting mistakes. Whoever the person is, the mistake-making possibility always remains, as the person is, after all, a normal human being just like all others.\\r\\n   In literature, we do have  the age-old history of typos and misprints, but that's not all that literature shows about humans making mistakes. There are whole books, series of them published on the topic of mistakes. If that wasn't enough, there are books in both fiction and non-fiction that depict lifestories of tragic heroes, their mistakes and their downfall. For example, Achille's mother made the fatal mistake of forgetting to dip her son's ankle in holy water, eventually killing the otherwise immortal hero. Even in literature, it seems that humans cannot escape making mistakes, however heroic and supernatural they are.\\r\\n   And lastly, historic examples of nobel and grand people making grand mistakes exist in numerous numbers. Hitler the stragetical genius made mistakes, Tesla the genius lived in poverty, even Princess Diana forgot to use her seatbelt. These people would have done different things if not for those small mistakes. But regardless of that fact, we have seen fallen heroes for millenia, proving that that especial characteristic hasn't detached from us in the least.\\r\\n   Had all those people that ever lived not made those small, everyday mistakes they would have lead different lives. But that wouldn't have been possible. after all, they are all humans. Maybe instead of trying to make ourselves more perfect and mistake-less, we should try to accept and predict our mistakes. After all, it is a permanent characteristic of the human race.\",\n",

       " (\"Living in the world, people often find similarities of them and other people. Sometimes, they find new aspect of them by seeing and knowing other people. In other words, the more we learn about other people, the more we learn about ourselves. \\r\\n   The case when a person learns more about him or herself by learning other people is well represented in the Jane Austen's novel, Pride and Prejudice. The main character, Elizabeth, gets a prejudice about Darcy as a proud and arrogant man, when he arrogantly refuses to dance with her. After this first meeting she sees all Darcy's behaviors negatively. When she hears a rumor that he impeded the love between her sister Jane and her lover Bingley, she easily judges this rumor to be true and her prejudice to Darcy develops. However, in fact, Darcy did not intend to impede the love, and confesses this fact to Elizabeth. Realizing the truth of Darcy and gradually learning that he was in fact a kind man, Elizabeth sees her unreasonable prejudices and learns about herself to be caught by prejudice. Finally, she abandon her prejudice. In this novel, one learns about herself by learning about the other person.\\r\\n   Not only novel, but also my experience shows that learning about other people helps us to learn about  ourselves. When I was in middle school, I always saw my friend named Seok In to be pretentious. However, observing more deeply of him, I became to think of myself. In truth, I was the same to him. I was also so pretentious. By learning about my friend more deeply, I learned about myself better.\\r\\n   In conclusion, more learning about other people provokes us to learn about ourselves more. Two examples above - a novel and my experience- prove this fact. Consequently, one has to research and learn more about other person to improve him or herself.\",\n",

       " ('Development in modern days has undeniably contributed to the convenient society we live in. Transportation, communication, production and other innumerable aspects have been affected by modern technology. But problems concerning the environment and alter of human culture has been elaborated ever since. Therefore rapid development should be controlled to make not only a healthy environment but also to achieve enhanced human culture.\\r\\n\\tThe Volga River, which is the longest river in Europe, has for long been the water basin of 60 million Russians. But currently 97 percent of the water is inedible and the other 3 percent needs sophisticated procedures of purification in order to drink. Such disaster occurred ever since the Russian government started major constructions on the river. 7 multi-function dams were constructed and flooded rivers back hundreds of kilometers and slowed down the water streams and caused the decrease in the water to regenerate itself. In such a manner development might have permitted Russia with a better electricity supply but resulted in millions of people to lose reliable drinking water and ruined the adjacent environment.\\r\\n\\tEver since the development of advanced electric devices computers and mobile phones have functioned to increase the efficiency of all industries throughout the world. Documents could be processed anywhere, anytime by anyone in need, and everyone could come in touch right away. However such advantages might have enhanced industries but the humans. The increasing number of adults with health problems can partially be attributed to such change in system of the workforce. Rather than moving around to meet people, get documents and hold other procedures everything is being done in front of computers making workers static. Since the amount people move has decreased due to the static method working and improved nutrition people tend to get fat and confront numerous illnesses such as cancer, diabetes. Like this development has resulted the alter of human culture and induced health problems for humans.\\r\\nAlthough various development has endowed human much convenience their antecedents have never experienced its consequences have not always been pleasurable. The advent of advanced technology has provided mass transportation such as airplanes, subways, cars and etc. However at the same time, the pollution caused by the transportation system and the frequent accidents have devastated countless lives. Thus development should be repressed unless a satisfactory method to solve the linked problems is presented.',\n",

       " ('The greatest griefs are indeed caused by ourselves. As humans, personal actions and results are always of greater importance and felt with emotion of a totally different magnitude compared to unrelated situations. This is seen through many cases, personal everyday life situations, famous historical events, and even written about in literature.\\r\\n   For a personal example of one causing oneself great grief is if one were to do something to insult or hurt a friend\\'s feelings, that it would hurt oneself more than if another person had hurt one\\'s friend\\'s feelings. That is, since \"I\" was the person who harmed \"my\" friend, it makes \"me\" more worried about it, feel more sorrow, apologize to a deeper degree and such. Which shows how we create the greatest griefs : it cannot be a great grief unless created by oneself, since one does not care for other happenings to such a great degree.\\r\\n   But this also happened in historical events. Brutus murdrered Caesar, and Christopher Sterk was stolen of the program DOS to Bill Gates. Brutus greatly mourned killing his best friend and companion, and Sterk was greatly disappointed in the fact that he had let himself lose his prized possesion to a mere fellow worker. If they had gotten into those situations due to another person\\'s fault, they would only get mad at the person responsible. But, since they themselves were responsible for their actions, they felt more grief than usual.\\r\\n   In literature, a famous example might be from \"Lord of the Flies\", where Peter leads his band of children to become a wild, barbarious tribe living on meat and killing fellow human beings without the slightest remorse. But when they finally get the chance to go back home, they feel worse than they ever felt, collapsing with tears in their eyes. As mentioned, even in extreme conditions, people keep to their emotions in sub-consiciousness. In this case, the emotions were trigerred by their return home.\\r\\n   So, as shown above, people feel the greatest greif when they themselves cause it, since people are human beings that feel more emotion than normal when fronted with a situation that they are responsible for. This has been a trait as old as emotions, and it will continue even in the future.',\n",

       " (\"Today, the world is changing so rapidly that people have to try to adapt to this changing world. Some people claim that innovation is driven by our attempt to adapt to a changing world. However, I disagree with this idea. Rather, I believe that the innovation leads to the changing of the world, making people attempt to adapt to this change.\\r\\n   History shows this fact that the innovation leads to the change and people attempt to adapt well. When the Industrial Revolution started, it had such an innovative impact to people that it forced people to change their way of lives. Before the revolution, people only had thought of hand-made products. However, the Industrial Revolution changed the whole world. It made machines that could produce products massively, so that people's hands were not needed anymore. It made people who only used their hands at that time extremely poor. As a result of this, people had to adapt to this change. They had to work in the factory, where they did not made products directly, but only aided machines to work well. So, innovation led to the change of the world, which then led to the attempt to adapt.\\r\\n   Also, in modern society, it is well shown that innovation is the subject of the change that makes people try to adapt. The invention of the car is one example. The invention of the car was such a surprising and pleasing event to people. It made it possible for people who had to walk hardly before to move far conveniently. The convenience of the car attracted people, and so, many people in the world became to own their own cars. This greatly changed the world because it quickly led to the industrialization of society. However, adaptation was needed. People had to learn how to ride their cars. To ride the cars, they had to get licenses allowing them to drive. Also, in this case, innovation led to the change, and made people try to adapt. \\r\\n   In conclusion, contrary to many people's beliefs, innovation drives people to attempt to adapt to a changing world. Two examples above, industrial revolution and the invention of the car, prove this fact. Without innovation, there would not be changes and adaptation.\",\n",

       " (\"Sometimes, when we watch news channels, we can hear that the saliva on the ground led police to the criminal. It is due to the genetic science, which points out someone by his or her own biological characteristics. Genetic testing is also used in finding family, especially when there is a catastrophy. when people are buried under the landslide, and police has nothing to identify them, then they can take genetic testing and figure out the family. Like this, genetic testing is used in various places, and it is certain method with great reliability.\\r\\n\\r\\n    Last year, after tsunami struck Asian countries, there were millions of people who were part with their family. The famous one though, is a baby in the hospital in Sri Lanka. The baby was claimed to be their child by more than 10 parents, and what happened was the genetic testing. Finally, the baby found its parents. Like in this story, genetic testing helps such problem. There was a case of an adopted child trying to find her biological parents. After years have spent, she finally reached a woman who was believed to be her mother. However, there were no record proving that the woman was the mother. Thus, what they did was genetic testing, and she was proved  to be the daughter of the woman. They did couple more testings to make sure, and all showed that they were biological family. This tells that genetic testing is reliable.\\r\\n\\r\\n    Genetic testing is widely used in forensic  science. Famous due to C.S.I series, forensic science uses genetic testing and biological examination to narrow down the range of suspects. Every particle of human being, from hair to saliva, can be the material for genetic testing. When police finds several suspects, and when they find all the biological evidences they can, then they gather suspects' biological information from suspects. Then, they match each of them with the evidence found in the crime scene. If there is someone matching the found evidence, then he or she is the right one. This means that genetic testing can be used in such serious problem, and that shows the reliability of genetic testing, which is extremely high.\\r\\n\\r\\n    People need to have something reliable during their lives. That is why they have family, house, and work. Genetic testing, also, is very dependable, and it is widely used. The fact that it is used in forensic science is the key point. Being used in such a serious case, genetic testing is something with professionality and high credit.\",\n",

       " (\"People often conflict between conservation and change. People in the side of conservation value traditions and are afraid of the harm that changes would bring. However, people who prefer the change try to escape from boring lives that are always the same, and improve their lives by changing. Throughout history, these attempt and passion to bring about changes always appear. \\r\\n  In art history, the passion to bring about change is clearly shown. In ancient greek, people valued people themselves, and tried to describe the realistic emotions of people like the anxieties, happinesses, and sadnesses. However, people wanted to change ,and they created the innovative styles of art. Later, people created Impressionism, Romanticism, Cubism, and Surrealism, which were very different from previous way of art. For example, Cubism broke the common sense of art that draw the only one side that is shown, and described the various sides of people in one picture. Surrealism was even more innovative, that it showed fantasy, which can not occur in reality. As shown in this example, there has been great passion to bring about change.\\r\\n   French Revolution also proves this claim. Before this revolution, people in France was in extreme poor conditions. Because of too much taxes to nobles, they could not own enough properties that could maintain their lives. Contrary to this poor people, the king and nobles in palace enjoyed lavish lives and spent so much money. Although people had thought this to be God's intent before, later they changed their minds. They were resented at the great gap between them and the nobles, and tried to improve their lives by revolution. Their ardent passions to change were accomplished by the winning of the war against the nobles, and could acheive the change; improved lives, powers, and rights. \\r\\n   People could let things remain the same as before, but did not. As proven in art history and French Revolution, they always tried changing. Thanks to these attempts, they could gain what they wanted, and show fresh ways of expression.\",\n",

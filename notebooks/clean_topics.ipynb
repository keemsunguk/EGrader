Furthermore, in a survey conducted by the Observer over 90 percent of the respondents were parents who indicated that prime-time television-programs that are shown between 7p.m. and 9p.m.-should show less violence.

Moreover, in a recent survey conducted by the Groveton honor council, a majority of students said that they would be less likely to cheat with an honor code in place than without.\"',\n",

Unfortunately, according to reports from local hunters, the deer populations are declining.

Any water present would have evaporated and gone off into space. As the planet approached its current size, however, its gravitation became strong enough to hold gases and water vapor around it as an atmosphere. Because comets are largely ice made up of frozen water and gases, a comet striking Earth then would have vaporized. The resulting water vapor would have been retained in the atmosphere, eventually falling as rain on the cooled and solidified surface of Earth. Therefore, the water in Earth\\'s oceans must have originated from comets.\"',\n",

When interviewed for a recent study, youth-league softball players in several major cities also reported psychological pressure from coaches and parents to win games. Furthermore, education experts say that long practice sessions for these sports take away time that could be used for academic activities.

But now that our town planning committee wants to purchase the land and build a school there, we should reconsider this issue. If the land becomes a school site, no shopping centers or houses can be built there, and substantial acreage would probably be devoted to athletic fields. There would be no better use of land in our community that this, since a large majority of our children participate in sports, and Scott Woods would continue to benefit our community as natural parkland.\"',\n",

It show an example of Brookville and assumes that the increase in the property values in Brookville is due to the set of restrictions on landscaping and housepainting which was adopted seven years ago. But there is no evidence that those regulations actually contributed to raising the property values. The property values are affected by many factors and seven years is a long time for other factors rather than landscaping and housepainting could have affected the property values. Before adopting the own set of restrictions, the committee should study the direct relationship between the restrictions in Brookville and the increase in the property values.\\r\\n\\r\\n     The property values can be affected by many factors. If they were increased, it could be due to a new factory built in a nearby village or a new department store in the village. The policy of the city government could also change the property valuse such as building a new highway near the village or making the village the center of business. Compared with these examples, the restrictions on landscaping and housepainting may be less important or have little effect. And those restrictions could have been negative in increasing the property values by causing inconvenience to homeowners. Seven years is a long time and many other factors could have involved in the property value increase. \\r\\n\\r\\n     If the committee really wants to raise the property values and its strategy is adopting a set of restrictions on landscaping and housepainting, the committee should study the direct relationship between the restrictions and the property valuse in Brookville, whether they have been positive or negative, or even have any effect.

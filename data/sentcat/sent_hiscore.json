classes."}, {"text": "However, if she study at home using computers or television, she can study at a convenient time at her late night or only on weekends by online program."}, {"text": "Secondly, learning by computers or television can be more effective."}, {"text": "I can study in a good condition and fully concentrate all the time due to the advantage that I can adjust my own studying schedule."}, {"text": "Usually, the effectiveness of learning is reduced when I force myself to study with a bad condition."}, {"text": "In addition, I can play some important parts again and again or

or ten minutes to explain the problem to someone who is in charge of the Customer Service Department and find out what they intend to do to solve the problem."}, {"text": "In addition, I can explain the problem more clearly by complaining in person."}, {"text": "If I write a letter, I can not be as clear as I can speak my dissatisfaction  in person."}, {"text": "A good example of this situation is that when the new computer that I had bought had some problems, I brought it back to the store, asked a salesclerk to plug it in and showed him exactly what the problems were."}, {"text": "Since I did not know computer language"}, {"text": "well, this was a good way to get my point across."}, {"text": "He took care of the probems immediately."}, {"text": "Furthermore, if the correction is not good enough, I can make another appeal, so my presence itself is a powerful means of demanding the correction."}, {"text": "Thus, the visit has resolved my difficulty easily."}, {"text": "In conclusion, while complaining in writing is a gentler way to register dissatisfaction, I have always tried to complain in person whenever i have needed to make a complaint."}, {"text": "I have found that the personal touch can really save time in getting a problem solved because it is much faster than writing"}, {"text": "and it is the easiest way to express clearly what the problem is."},

other side of the fence\"."}, {"text": "No matter what we have, we always want something more."}, {"text": "I agree that people are never satified with what they have because it is a part of human nature to want more than what we have and media and advertising entice us to always want more in today's society."}, {"text": "First of all, I believe that wanting more than what we have is a part of our very nature."}, {"text": "Most people are always striving for a better job, a nice place to live in, a fancier car , or more expensive clothes."}, {"text": "They think that if they could have a better house or a better car, they would instantly be satisfied."}, {"text": "For a while, they might be content, but soon they will see something else that would make them happy."}, {"text": "There is always something new that people want to have, no matter how much they already have."}, {"text": "This is because we care about what other people think and want to impress them."}, {"text":

dissatisfied."}, {"text": "Suppose we see a car advertisement on TV."}, {"text": "Does this advertisement tell us about something that will eventually improve our life?"}, {"text": "I doubt it."}, {"text": "Rather, watching the advertisement on TV will constantly accuse you of your six-year-old car which looks a little rusty now."}, {"text": "We see images of happy people driving aroun in a new car."}, {"text": "Subconsciously, we want that car because we want to be like those people even though we have a car that functions perfectly."}, {"text": "In conclusion, though it would be nice to be satisfied with what we have, the fact is that we are not."}, {"text": "It is human nature to want more than what we have, and also companies and advertisers take advantage of these fats to fool us into believing the more we have the happier we will be."}, {"text": "For these reasons, I agree that people are never satisfied with what they have."}, {"text": "Throughout my life, I have been lucky

year had no significant effect, and the sales of the home applications will continuously decline because those in the past year declined."}, {"text": "However, there could be an alternate explanation."}, {"text": "Perhaps, it was only temporary phenomenon because last year the economic situation in the country was more terrible than any other years."}, {"text": "Hence, overall sale result of the past year over the whole market could be devastated regardless of the advertising effect."}, {"text": "Or maybe, a huge new home application company appeared last year, which result in

easily recognize the tunes used in advertisement unlike high school students."}, {"text": "Instead, a housewife might be affected more strongly by advertisements in a magazine about cooking or beauty,

conclusion, the conclusion that Eco-power should switch to advertisements featuring to a distinctive song to boost company profits is not logically convincing as it stands."}, {"text": "To strengthen the argument, the author should show that high school students can represent the whole people and the main target of home application and that of soft drinks and fast-food restaurants are similar."},

directors."}, {"text": "Moreover, reading fiction is not restricted to time and space."}, {"text": "The main reason is that books are small and light enough to be carried anywhere."}, {"text":

conclusion, without any doubt, I definitely prefer to read fiction."}, {"text": "The reasons are that I can easily pick up a book and read a novel which can challenge me to dream of imaginary people

all, giving students freedom to attend classes play a pivotal role in improving the quality of education."}, {"text": "This is largely because that a number of studies have clearly demonstrated that

attendance is completely optional."}, {"text": "The students enthusiastically participate in class debates by raising hand their voice opinions, diligently taking notes, and asking questions."},

children's physical and mental health."}, {"text": "It is largely because life in country imposes less stress on people thanks to the slow-paced and relaxing lifestyle of a rural life."}, {"text":

speak."}, {"text": "Moreover, a garrulous person could destroy hard working environments."}, {"text": "For example, one loquacious worker could annoy all other workers."}, {"text": "If a voluble worker distracted them, their work could never be prolific."}, {"text": "However, sometimes, a person needs to be encouraged by a talkative person."}, {"text": "When a person is having a conflict, another person tries to help them or to talk to him will help him to feel better."}, {"text": "Knowing the opportune time to talk to someone or just to keep my mouth shut is another quality that a good partner must have."}, {"text": "In short, a person with patience will not talk abusively and will be dogged with all their work."}, {"text": "Moreover, a person who knows when to speak will never disrupt the office, will never make unnecessary comments, and will talk to someone when other co-workers need courage."}, {"text": "That is why I think these two factors make a perfect co-worker."}, {"text": "There are a variety of preferences over trying new thing."}, {"text": "Some like to only do something in the field where they are already expert, because it is familiar with them."}, {"text": "However, I prefer trying new thing for reasons of boredom in old thing and widening my knowledge and experience."}, {"text": "First of all, I do not like boredom"}, {"text": "I felt when repeating same things."}, {"text": "I am inclined to loose interest in what I am already good."}, {"text": "On the other hand, it is purely fun and exciting for me to do new project or work."}, {"text": "Even if I often make a mistake while I am doing new task, it is challenging for me."}, {"text": "For example, when I became an expert in swimming, I felt tedious in the sport."}, {"text": "So I started to learn tennis"}, {"text": "and lately I am enjoying my morning exercise time playing tennis."}, {"text": "Second, challenging new things extends my knowledge and perspective."}, {"text": "Trying new things provide me a variety of opportunities to learn what I don\u2019t know."}, {"text": "For instance, when I challenged to join the army, I was able to increase a lot of military knowledge and information, and through the various exercise, I could learn leadership and teamwork."}, {"text": "Also When I tried joining an internship program of General Electronics, I was able to learn how a company works and the importance of human network."}, {"text": "In conclusion, even though some people love to only do what they are already good at, because they do not want to loose faces by making mistakes in new fields, as far as I am concerned, it is more favorable for me to experience new things."}, {"text": "This is because I get bored easily with doing same things"}, {"text": "and I could widen my knowledge and perspective."}, {"text": "In the past few decades, especially after the industrial revolution, people were only interested in the improvement of new technologies and the convenience that comes out from these new technologies."}, {"text": "Therefore, the number of factories and cars increased, which caused serious environmental pollution."}, {"text": "Consequently, the earth we are living in today faces serious global warming and floods or storms."}, {"text": "As a solution, I am convinced that people should start riding bicycles rather than driving cars and should make more dams."}, {"text": "First, riding bicycles prevents global warming from growing too serious."}, {"text": "As everybody knows, global warming makes the earth's temperature to increase high and this phenomenon rushes glaciers to melt faster as well."}, {"text": "Many scientists say that global warming is mostly caused by cars' fuels."}, {"text": "Therefore, one way to reduce global warming is to ride a bike when going to school or work rather than driving a car."}, {"text": "However, since cars are one of the most important modes of transportation today, it is not easy for people to start riding bicycles right away."}, {"text": "Accordingly, the government should make a bicycle campaign to persuade people to ride bikes."}, {"text": "To be specific, the campaign would be effective through TV commercials, the most popular medium of advertisement, or popular celebrities could start riding bicycles first, which will influence people to follow."}, {"text": "This is because people think whatever celebrities do or whatever is on TV is cool."}, {"text": "Also, most importantly, governments should make bike roads."}, {"text": "Even if they persuade all the people to ride bikes, if they do not construct roads for bikes, there would be no use for the campaign."}, {"text": "Consequently, I believe that governments should build bike roads like highways so people can ride bikes for a far distance as well as a short distance."}, {"text": "These plans show that if we, ourselves, try to ride bikes actively, it will protect against global warming."}, {"text": "Second, dams reduce the number of casualties from floods or severe storms."}, {"text": "Dams hold flooding waters when there's heavy rain."}, {"text": "This positive effect is proven by looking at the results that existing dams bring whenever a storm hits countries, particularly in Korea; the region with a dam is less affected by floods than the region without a dam."}, {"text": "For example, in 2004, it had been controversial whether a dam was needed in Kangwondo, South Korea."}, {"text": "After a long debate, the decision was made not to make a dam."}, {"text": "However, that was a mistake."}, {"text": "In 2006, two years after the talk, there was a great flood which caused injuries to people as well as region damage."}, {"text": "However, some people say that dams are not necessary  because floods do not appear everyday and making dams cost too much."}, {"text": "Though, I do not agree with that idea because the financial problem comes from the restoration is more expensive than building the dams and saving human beings from floods that could appear in anytime are more important than worrying about the expenditure of building dams."}, {"text": "In result, to be safe from catastrophic disasters from nature, dams are definitely needed."}, {"text": "In conclusion, among many ways to solve nature disaster problems such as global warming or floods, I strongly believe that bikes and dams are the best solutions to the problem-not only because bikes protect people from global warming but also because dams reduce casualties from flooding."}, {"text": "Unlike a few decades ago, South Korea is now popular and well-known in the world."}, {"text": "However, even though Korea has a number of merits, many Koreans say that they sometimes feel inferior to Americans or Europeans."}, {"text": "Therefore, I am convinced that Koreans should  learn many foreign languages and possess honesty in order to have pride anywhere in the world."}, {"text": "First, learning many foreign languages allows Koreans to express their feelings easily to foreigners."}, {"text": "It is true that if you are able to speak many foreign languages, many people envy you."}, {"text": "This is because since people today are living in a global age, people who know many foreign languages or foreign countries' cultures can survive in the world."}, {"text": "Imagine a Korean car company tries to sell  cars in America but cannot speak English."}, {"text": "Then, it is hard to advertise the company in English and the company will fail to succeed in America."}, {"text": "Accordingly,  knowing other countries' languages enables South Korea to have more opportunities to gain exposure in the world."}, {"text": "For example, unlike South Korea, North Korea government decrees citizens to avoid learning foreign languages and emphasizes their language as the best in the world"}, {"text": "so they have no reasons to learn foreign languages."}, {"text": "This is why North Korea can not progress in the world and is regarded as the worst economic country."}, {"text": "Even though it is understandable that North Korea has ardent patriotism to use only their language, they definitely should adapt to other countries' languages and cultures to evolve."}, {"text": "Consequently, this example shows that knowing foreign languages does play an important role if you want your country to be superior among other countries."}, {"text": "Second, honesty and morality instills a good impression in foreigners."}, {"text": "As one might expect, if one steals somebody's property, he would be criticized and people might not ever trust him anymore."}, {"text": "Like how honesty and morality play an important role in general, these traits are also important if you do not want to disgrace your country."}, {"text": "For example, a Korean scientist Hwang Woo Suck, claimed in 2004 that he created stem cell lines from cloned embryos and the following year said he was able to develop patient-specific stem cells."}, {"text": "The South Korean government gave him full financial backing to continue his research, and the entire nation celebrated his scientific feat."}, {"text": "However, subsequent investigation showed he fabricated the results."}, {"text": "Due to Hwang's stem cell scandal, many people in the world formed a bad image of Koreans and all scientists around the world criticized him."}, {"text": "In such a case, because of a scientist's greed to be famous, it is hard for Koreans to have a national pride."}, {"text": "This explains that having integrity is conducive to having  pride in one's nation."}, {"text": "In conclusion, among many important factors in order to keep the pride of being Korean, learning English and having honesty would be the best way to live anywhere proudly as Koreans-not only because foreign languages enable you to communicate with other countries' nations but also because honesty allows you to have a great image."}, {"text": "There is a disagreement over which ability is more significant, ability to work independently or ability to work with other team members."}, {"text": "Some insist that working well independently is more necessary aspect as a good worker because it proves sincere."}, {"text": "However, in my opinion, I think that working well with a group of people on a team is more essential quality as a good worker for reasons of the recent large scale of task and harmonious relationship with clients."}, {"text": "First of all, in modern society, the scale of project is getting larger and more complex."}, {"text": "So even if an individual has super ability, the individual can not complete the whole project alone in these days."}, {"text": "Cooperation with other people in a team is necessary to finish the large scale project successfully."}, {"text": "For instance, when I worked in General Electronics as an intern, although one of my coworkers was very good at working alone, the project which research and analyze Korean electronic machines market was too much to manage by oneself."}, {"text": "He was not good at working together."}, {"text": "Finally he dropped the internship before finishing the contract period."}, {"text": "Second, the person who has ability to work well with a group of people in a team is most likely to make good relationship with clients."}, {"text": "It is important for employers to project good impression to client and communicate well with them."}, {"text": "Because working well with other team member means good interpersonal skills, the ability could apply to relationship with clients in same way."}, {"text": "For instance, in my internship period, I led my project team as a leader."}, {"text": "I received good evaluation from many clients as well as my team members."}, {"text": "On the other hand, even though one of my coworkers did good job on his part of paper work, he got several complaints from clients because of his unkindness and poor communication skill."}, {"text": "In conclusion, even though some people argue that ability to work independently is the most important because it means sincerity, as far as I am concerned, I believe that ability to work with team is more considerable."}, {"text": "This is because scale of work is getting bigger these days and good interpersonal skill has advantageous effect on relationship with clients."}, {"text": "There are a variety of preferences about choosing jobs."}, {"text": "Some like a high paying job even if they can spend little time with their family because of long working hours."}, {"text": "This is because they want to make much money."}, {"text": "However, I prefer lower paying job with shorter time for reasons of spending longer time with my family and my personality hating long work."}, {"text": "First of all, family is the most significant value in my life."}, {"text": "I do not want to give up the time with family for anything."}, {"text": "Even if my father earned a lot of money, because he spent many time with me and my brother, my family has strong connection."}, {"text": "I want to spend long time with my father, mother and brother after getting job."}, {"text": "On the other hand, my uncle earned more money than my father."}, {"text": "However because he was always in a hurry"}, {"text": "and he did not allot time for their family, now his families are unfamiliar each other."}, {"text": "My cousin envy my family\u2019s bonding."}, {"text": "Family is more considerable value than money for me."}, {"text": "Second, I do not like working too long."}, {"text": "I am inclined to feel tired and bored when I am working for long time."}, {"text": "For example, when I joined the internship in General Electronics, I had to work from 8 in the morning to 11 in the nigh."}, {"text": "Even if I made much money, I was not happy."}, {"text": "Two month later my health even got worse."}, {"text": "On the contrary, during the last summer vacation, I worked in Samsung, Korean company, as an intern."}, {"text": "Working hour was from 9 am to 5 pm"}, {"text": "and I could have a tea time in working hours."}, {"text": "Although I earn smaller money in there, I could enjoy the works because it was not long."}, {"text": "In conclusion, even though some people prefer jobs which give high salary and require long work time for reason of making a success, I like jobs which guarantee longer time with my family and give lower salary."}, {"text": "This is because family is my most important value in my life"}, {"text": "and I do not like work long every day."}, {"text": "There are a variety of opinions as to life pace."}, {"text": "Some like a faster pace in their life to accomplish their object."}, {"text": "They insist that the faster life style bring money and success to them."}, {"text": "However, in my opinion, I think that a slower pace in my life is more advantageous for me for reasons of avoiding stress and preserving really precious value like family and friendship."}, {"text": "First of all, I am inclined to stress out about life at a faster pace."}, {"text": "A series of works I must finish quickly give me a lot of pressure."}, {"text": "For example, when I worked in General Electronics, my first job, I wanted to win success."}, {"text": "So I kept working without any rest or holiday."}, {"text": "Even if many people recognized my successful outcomes, my stomach was always upset"}, {"text": "and I was not able to sleep well due to the stress that I had to do something quickly."}, {"text": "After I quit the company, I have lived my life at a slower pace."}, {"text": "I take a tea time at least once a day and travel with my brother."}, {"text": "This change makes me happier."}, {"text": "Second, I don\u2019t want to loose really considerable value in my life."}, {"text": "The people who are always in a hurry for success are difficult to meet their friends or spend their time for family."}, {"text": "This is because they start another work right after finishing a task."}, {"text": "Finally the people could make much money, but they will loose true friendship and love between family members."}, {"text": "For instance, my uncle had always tight schedules because of works and meeting with business partners, clients, and employees in his company."}, {"text": "He did not have time to assign to their son, daughter, wife, mother, father, brother, sister, and friends."}, {"text": "When he was sixty years old, even though he owned a big company, he felt lonely and regretted that he did not have enough time with family and friends."}, {"text": "In conclusion, even though some people prefer being in a hurry all the time to win success, as far as I am concerned, I believe that slower pace of life is more favorable to me."}, {"text": "This is because I don\u2019t like to be under pressure"}, {"text": "and I do not want to miss the important value in my life."}, {"text": "There are a variety of reasons why people work."}, {"text": "Of course earning a living is one of the most significant reasons for working."}, {"text": "In my opinion, I think that the other reasons are getting achievement and helping other people."}, {"text": "First, people work for their dream and object."}, {"text": "Even if I would have tons of money, I would do my best to design a wonderful architecture."}, {"text": "This is because building a fantastic architecture is my dream and object in my life."}, {"text": "If I design a building such like Opera House in Sydney, I would get great achievement and feel happy."}, {"text": "We can find many people working for their dream."}, {"text": "For instance, Jack Welch, one of millionaires in the world, has already enough money for his life."}, {"text": "However he is working actively as a CEO."}, {"text": "He said that running his own company successfully has been his dream since he was young and gives big pleasure to him."}, {"text": "Second, some people work for helping others."}, {"text": "We can see people who work for the less fortunate people almost without payment."}, {"text": "For example, Doctor Lee, one of the famous physicians in Korea, has worked for African for last twenty years."}, {"text": "Even though nobody pay for him and his health is not good, he serves for the poor in Africa."}, {"text": "He is not working for money."}, {"text": "He is working to help the people in need."}, {"text": "Also, Mother Theresa was known for her unceasing service for the poor."}, {"text": "The Nobel Peace Prize winners such as Mother Theresa did not work for making profit."}, {"text": "If they wanted to be rich, they should not have been involved in those works."}, {"text": "In conclusion, even though making money is considerable reason for working, people work for feeling achievement and assist other people."}, {"text": "There are a variety of opinions over whether working for a large firm is better than working for a small firm."}, {"text": "Some insist that working for a small company is great because employees can work in intimate atmosphere."}, {"text": "However, in my opinion, I think that working for a big company is more beneficial for me in the light of big network and various amenities."}, {"text": "First of all, I could make a big human network."}, {"text": "Because there are a lot of employees in the large organization, I could get opportunities to make relationship with the many people."}, {"text": "The network will be the crucial assets in my life."}, {"text": "For instance, during my summer internship in General Electronics, I met over one hundred people in various positions in the company."}, {"text": "I am receiving lots of precious information through keeping relationship with them."}, {"text": "Updated information from them considerably assists me to prepare my future."}, {"text": "Second, I could use a variety of amenities."}, {"text": "Usually a large company offers the facilities for fitness and taking a rest, and the facility taking care of babies."}, {"text": "Furthermore, a large company helps clerks\u2019 self development."}, {"text": "The amenities would make my life richer and more comfortable."}, {"text": "For instance, my mother and father kept working while they raised me and my younger brother."}, {"text": "This was because their large company had facility taking care of babies for working hours."}, {"text": "In conclusion, even though some people argue that a small company is advantageous for workers for the reason of the familiar atmosphere, as far as I am concerned, I believe that a large company is more favorable for me because I could meet a lot of people and the company provide a number of amenities."}, {"text": "There are a variety of preferences as to the hour of rising."}, {"text": "Some like to get up late in the morning and work until early dawn or late night, because this working hour style increases their originality."}, {"text": "However, in the case of me, I prefer to wake up early in the morning for reasons of my biorhythm and my schedule."}, {"text": "First of all, my conditions of body and brain are at the best level in the morning."}, {"text": "I tend to be concentrated very well on my study or work especially in the forenoon."}, {"text": "On the other hand, in the late night, my concentration gets worse and I feel tired easily."}, {"text": "So it is efficient for me to rise up early and study from the time."}, {"text": "For instance, since I changed my sleeping schedule from 3 AM- 10 AM to 11 PM- 6 AM in my high school years, my grade has been increased constantly even if I am sleeping for the same hours."}, {"text": "This is because I am able to study with higher concentration in the forenoon."}, {"text": "Second, I have many schedules in the morning."}, {"text": "My classes start at 9 AM from Monday through Friday and my worship service begins at 10 AM on Sunday morning."}, {"text": "I want to show my best feature not sleepy eyes to my professors, pastor, friends in my school and church."}, {"text": "There are not a few students dozing off during the classes in the morning."}, {"text": "However, my habit to rise up early helps me to be active in these morning schedules and project a good image to other people."}, {"text": "I am receiving top level estimations from my professors giving classes in the morning."}, {"text": "In conclusion, even though some people love to work from noon to early dawn and sleep in the rest of the day in the light of increasing originality, I like to work from early morning to evening and sleep in the remaining of the day."}, {"text": "This is because getting up early in the morning fits to my biorhythm and makes me perform my important schedules in the forenoon more actively."}, {"text": "Supervisor has big influence over whole organization."}, {"text": "So it is important to get a good leader for a corporation."}, {"text": "There is a variety of qualities to be a great boss."}, {"text": "Among them, I believe that professionalism and communication skills are important aspects, because they will assist group to be professional and motivated."}, {"text": "First of all, professionalism is one of the most significant conditions of qualified leader."}, {"text": "When the boss is an expert in the field or shows employee effort to be professional, the supervisor is able to control his or her people effectively and motivate employees to be experts in their own areas."}, {"text": "For instance, Jack Welch, Chief Executive officer in General Electronics, is known for his professionalism."}, {"text": "Wherever he goes, he tries to be professional in the new area."}, {"text": "His passion and professional knowledge becomes good model to his employees."}, {"text": "His people respect and trust him."}, {"text": "Whole group he leads becomes professional and competitive."}, {"text": "Second, communication skills are an essential aspect."}, {"text": "Delivering information, sharing vision, catching employees\u2019 opinion, and understanding their demands are necessary to operate the organization efficiently."}, {"text": "Effective communication skills mentioned above the sentence will help a supervisor to incentive people and make company\u2019s atmosphere more comfortable."}, {"text": "For example, Choi, a group leader of SK which is a Korean company, is famous for his communication skill."}, {"text": "Because he is good at expressing his opinion and listening to his employees\u2019 voice, complaints from workers are much fewer than any other company in Korea."}, {"text": "As the result, SK is estimated that it has harmonious atmosphere in the office and the highest productivity per a worker in Korea."}, {"text": "In conclusion, even though there are numerous qualities of a leader, as far as I am concerned, professionalism and communication skills are the most essential conditions."}, {"text": "These qualities will assist his or her employees to be experts and to be motivated."}, {"text": "Finally, the supervisor with these two aspects will succeed in accomplishing the organization\u2019s purpose."}, {"text": "There are many wonderful things to represent my country such as Goreay ChungJa, a gold throne of Sinra dynasty, and a King\u2019s clothes in Chosun dynasty."}, {"text": "In my opinion, the best thing that could represent my country is \u201cChosun BaekJa\u201d which is a kind of white china made by the Chusun dynasty in Korea in 16th, 17th centuries."}, {"text": "This is because it is beautiful and represents important value of Korea."}, {"text": "First of all, \u201cChosun BaekJa\u201d is a very beautiful kind of ceramic."}, {"text": "It has purely white background and drawing of birds and flowers with blue color."}, {"text": "The pictures and contradiction of white and blue color are really fantastic."}, {"text": "Furthermore, the china has perfect symmetric shape."}, {"text": "Because of its beautiful color, picture, and shape, four hundred years ago, not only king but also the aristocracy of Korea enjoyed using these ceramic."}, {"text": "Nowadays, \u201cChosun BeakJa\u201d is displayed in many art museums in Korea and the wealthy upper classes in Korea like to display it in their houses."}, {"text": "Second, \u201cChosun BaekJa\u201d represents Korean traditional value such as honesty and purity."}, {"text": "The major characteristic of \u201cChosun BaekJa\u201d is white back ground."}, {"text": "In the word \u201cBaekJa\u201d, Baek means white in Korean."}, {"text": "Then white symbolizes honesty and purity in Korea."}, {"text": "Korean ancestors consider honesty and purity important and respected upright life."}, {"text": "Traditionally white has been the favorite color for Korean."}, {"text": "Since this china shows what important value is for Korean through its color, it could be a good thing representing my nation."}, {"text": "In conclusion, even though there are many precious tings that could stand for my country, as far as I am concerned, I believe that \u201cChosun BaekJa\u201d is the most proper thing to represent Korea."}, {"text": "This is because it has fantastic beauty and encompasses the representative values of Korea."}, {"text": "There are a variety of opinions over which is better between choosing a roommate and letting a university decide my roommate."}, {"text": "Some insist that it is better to have a school assign my roommate for reason of making a new friend."}, {"text": "However, in my opinion, I think that it is more favorable for me to choose a person who shares my room during over one semester for reasons of being able to avoid uncertainty of new roommate and making deeper relationship with my friend."}, {"text": "First of all, I can keep away from uncertainness of my new roommate."}, {"text": "If university makes a decision about my roommate, I am not sure whether my roommate will be even good or bad person."}, {"text": "This is because I do not have any information about new person who will stay with me."}, {"text": "A roommate might be a desirable person and he might be a terrible person."}, {"text": "For instance, in my university years, my first roommate was decided by school."}, {"text": "I had a really hard time because of his awful manners."}, {"text": "He played music loudly all the day and let his friends hang out in my room until late at night."}, {"text": "Next semester I was able to avoid this terrible situation by choosing my roommate."}, {"text": "Second, it would be a good opportunity to have deeper relationship with my old friend."}, {"text": "If I live with my friend for six months or one year, we would be much closer."}, {"text": "For example, in my university years, my second roommate was a close buddy in my high school years."}, {"text": "We chose each other as roommate."}, {"text": "While I lived with him for one year, we had a lot of conversation and spend much time hanging out together."}, {"text": "We got closer and now we are the best friend for one another."}, {"text": "I could develop the deep relationship with my friend by choosing the person I stay with."}, {"text": "In conclusion, even though some people prefer giving the right choosing their roommate to university, because they can make a new friend, as far as I am concerned, I believe that it is more advantageous for me to decide my roommate."}, {"text": "This is because I have no information about my roommate if university assigns my roommate"}, {"text": "and it is great chance to make deep relationship with my friend"}, {"text": "In my house, my parents, my sister , and I have our own room."}, {"text": "Among these rooms, if I were asked to choose the most important room in the house, I would choose bedroom for two main reasons."}, {"text": "The first reason is that I can have my privacy in the bedroom."}, {"text": "The other is that I find comfort in the bedroom."}, {"text": "First, my privacy is respected in the bedroom."}, {"text": "It is true that there's a time when I need to have my privacy, away from my family."}, {"text": "If there's no place to do my private tasks such as changing my clothes or talking with my boyfriend, it will bother both my family and me."}, {"text": "For example, last year, while I had a relationship with my boyfriend, I didn't tell my mom about it at first."}, {"text": "Therefore, whenever he called my mobile phone, I always went into my bedroom locking the door and talked with my boyfriend."}, {"text": "If I didn't have my bedroom back then, I would not able to talk with my boyfriend because my mom could here me talking in the living room."}, {"text": "However, since I am the lord of my room,  I am allowed to do whatever I want in my room, which could be something that my family does not know."}, {"text": "Second, My room gives me comfort."}, {"text": "As one might expect, every person has his or her own style to dress or to decorate rooms."}, {"text": "I also have my own style that I pursue."}, {"text": "However, since I'm living with my family, I am not allowed to decorate the house the wat I want; instead, my mom does that."}, {"text": "Therefore, the only room I have permission to decorate is my bedroom."}, {"text": "In this case, I can enjoy the style I adore and find the comfort by lining up beds and desks in places that are suitable for me."}, {"text": "For example, when I shared my room with my younger sister, I conceded to my sister to paint the wall in yellow which she bagged me to agree."}, {"text": "However, since yellow is not my favorite color, I felt so uncomfortable whenever I enter the room."}, {"text": "Now, I am satisfied with my room painted in pink and my furnitures arranged in the place that I feel the most comfortable with; I feel like I can study better in the room I decorated."}, {"text": "In conclusion, I like my bedroom the best in my house not only because my privacy is kept in my room, but also because I love the feeling of comfort in my room."}, {"text": "When living a life, there are so many tasks or thing that people feel like they should do even if they do not want to."}, {"text": "Mostly, people endure the temptation to play and study for better lives."}, {"text": "However, despite numerous things that you should do, I am convinced that when you are choosing a job or marrying a partner, you must do what you want to do."}, {"text": "First, choosing a job based on your interests allows you to have enjoyable life."}, {"text": "As one might expect, there are a number of doctors or lawyers changing their jobs even if they came all the way up to be doctors or lawyers."}, {"text": "This is because they felt like they should become doctors because of their parents' enforcement to earn money."}, {"text": "Then such doctors would be miserable everyday due to inconsistent interests."}, {"text": "For example, I read the book about a man who changed his job from being the president of a company to being a taxi driver."}, {"text": "His father was a chairman of the company and he wanted his son to take over the company."}, {"text": "He said in the book that he had no interest in running a business"}, {"text": "but he felt like he should inherit the company since his dad trusted him more than anyone."}, {"text": "After five months of running the business, he cede his position to another employee and became the taxi driver that he wanted."}, {"text": "He is happier with being a taxi driver now and has no regrets."}, {"text": "He chose the job that he felt like he should do at first then"}, {"text": "changed to the job that he really wanted to do, which he made a smart decision."}, {"text": "The taxi driver's experience shows that when choosing a job, nothing is more important than your own interests and desire."}, {"text": "Second, a husband or wife is the one who will stay with you forever."}, {"text": "Many people long to marry rich partners just because they have money."}, {"text": "However, I am sure that people should have integrity when choosing a partner."}, {"text": "For example, my friend's mom once had

time to choose a partner, people should follow their heart, never mind other people's enforcement."}, {"text": "In conclusion, people should choose a job or a partner they want--not only because jobs become fun when you have a interest in them but also because husbands or wives become part of your family after the wedding."}, {"text": "There are various kinds of friends; intelligent friends, pretty friends, reliable friends, etc."}, {"text": "Among many kinds of friends, If someone asked me what I want most in a friend, I would definitely choose reliability for two main reasons."}, {"text": "The first reason is that reliable friends are there for me when I'm struggling."}, {"text": "The other reason is that they listen to me truly when I need somebody to talk to."}, {"text": "First, reliable friends are always there when I need help."}, {"text": "It is true that everybody faces hard times, and when a person is having a serious problem, he is more likely to commit suicide or follow the wrong path, such as joining a gang."}, {"text": "Therefore, in such times, friends who can understand him and help him are necessary, which I believe is reliability."}, {"text": "Even if you have a smart friend, he is no good if he can't help you when you are having a hard time but just cares for himself."}, {"text": "For example, when my father was in twenties, he made a contract with his friend to inaugurate a new business."}, {"text": "However, his friend betrayed him and fled to other country with my dad's money that he invested to start the business together."}, {"text":

right now if it had not been for his reliable friend's help."}, {"text": "My dad's experience shows that friends who are reliable play an important role when people are agonizing with a serious problem."}, {"text": "Second, people can get rid of stress by talking with a friend who is reliable."}, {"text": "While working, people meet many strict bosses, numerous hard tasks, and displeased people, and they will eventually receive a great amount of stress."}, {"text": "In this case, many people visit a reliable friend and go on and on complaining about their bosses or hard tasks."}, {"text": "This is because friends who are reliable listen to a friend, care about a friend, and never betray a friend."}, {"text": "; that is the definition of reliability."}, {"text": "If they were not reliable friends, other friends would say that they are busy themselves doing their own business"}, {"text": "so they have no time to listen to a friend babbling about problems."}, {"text": "Accordingly, with reliable friends, people can get rid of their stress and find comfort."}, {"text": "For instance, according to the survey on Jung Ang Ilbo, a Korean national newspaper, about what do you want most in a friend when you are having a hard time,79% of people said they would like to have a friend who has reliability; because, reliable friends keep their secret and listen to what problems they have truly."}, {"text": "This example shows that reliable friends are the most desired by other friends when they need to have someone to talk to."}, {"text": "In conclusion, I would like friends who are reliable rather than friends who are humorous or fun--not only because such friends are always there for me but also because they listen to me earnestly when I need someone to talk to."}, {"text": "People mostly work because they need money to live."}, {"text": "However, there are more reasons why people work than just to earn money."}, {"text": "Among many reasons to work besides earning money, I believe that people work to progress their lives and to help others besides themselves."}, {"text": "First, having a job help people to progress their daily lives."}, {"text": "It is true that people without jobs have no goals for their futures but just sleep and eat everyday without knowing that time is passing."}, {"text": "However, people who have jobs have a sense of responsibility and have numerous tasks to do at work."}, {"text": "In such a condition, people who have jobs consider time as a valuable thing an plan their daily lives efficiently."}, {"text": "This is also why many old people, including my grandmother who is over sixty, find tasks to do, such as farming, in order to progress their lives by not just sitting around absently, wasting time."}, {"text": "For example, I read the book called You Can Do It!"}, {"text": "written by Jungen Yun , a Korean doctor."}, {"text": "Yun became a doctor at the age of 40."}, {"text": "He explained in the book that he was struggling after the breakup with his girlfriend."}, {"text": "Thus, for more than ten years, he did nothing but drink alcohol and smoke cigarettes."}, {"text": "Then, when he became 30, he realized that what he was doing was only harming himself."}, {"text": "He started to study then and became a doctor, which gave him a chance to go on further in his life."}, {"text": "At the end of the book, he left the comment"}, {"text": "saying\"Working is something that gives you energy in living a life."}, {"text": "\""}, {"text": "This shows that work definitely allows people to have a goal to progress."}, {"text": "Second, people work for helping others."}, {"text": "As one might expect, there are many jobs today that do not pay a good deal of money, such as being a garbage men, maid, etc."}, {"text": "Then why would some people be garbage men?"}, {"text": "For example, according to a research by Jungang, a Korean national newspaper, 72% of garbage men answered that they work as garbage men because they like to serve, there are no other reasons."}, {"text": "They included that they were happy with their job and they felt proud when they saw roads cleaned."}, {"text": "They believe that being a garbage men is not a shame because garbage men are necessary in order to keep the world clean"}, {"text": "and so they are helping others by making the world to be cleaned."}, {"text": "Moreover, contrary to popular belief, a recent study by Seoul University in Korea showed that 89% of doctors said that they work to cure people, not to gain money."}, {"text": "These examples show that people work because they want to help other and not just because they need money."}, {"text": "In conclusion, people have diverse reasons to work besides to earn money."}, {"text": "People not only work because they want to advance in living but also because they care about others as well."}, {"text": "In this world, there are many people who have succeeded in their lives."}, {"text": "I believe that the term\" successful people\" refers to those who are satisfied with how they are and those who enjoy their lives."}, {"text": "For these reasons, a number of people want to be successful in their lives."}, {"text": "In order to be successful in life, I am convinced that good effort is the most important characteristic a person should have."}, {"text": "It is logical for to main reasons."}, {"text": "The first reason is that nothing could defeat a person's effort."}, {"text": "The other is that other people admire people who try their best."}, {"text": "First, everything is possible through hard work."}, {"text": "Contrary to popular belief, in order to be successful in one's life, intelligence is not the most important characteristic that person should have."}, {"text": "Even if one is intelligent enough to become a doctor, he would not be able to succeed to be a doctor if he didn't try his best."}, {"text": "On the contrary, poor people or deformity people would be able to succeed in their lives doing whatever they want if they try their best."}, {"text": "Let me take Abraham Lincoln for an example."}, {"text": "According to his biography, he was born in a poor family; he even ate sand to endure hunger and lived in a tent."}, {"text": "Then, one day, he wanted to be the president of the United state of America and abolish the slavery."}, {"text": "Even though he had no money to buy books, he cleaned the library for checking out books free, and did anything to help himself on studying so he can be the president."}, {"text": "For the result, because of Lincoln's enthusiasm and effort to become the president, he finally became the president of America and overcame the poverty."}, {"text": "His rise from poverty shows that only thing that people need to be successful in their lives is good effort."}, {"text": "Second, people respect and admire people who try hard."}, {"text": "As one might expect, in school, teachers usually like students with good grades."}, {"text": "This is because teachers know that such students tried so hard to get good grades, enduring the temptation to play; therefore, such students have more rights to gain teachers' attentions than students who don't study."}, {"text": "Accordingly, people who make an effort for something instill a good impression in others."}, {"text": "For example, I saw a TV program about picking the next top model in America."}, {"text": "Contrary to my prediction, Nana became the next top model in America among other tall and pretty girls."}, {"text": "Nana was the shortest participant and had the worst score in the photo shoot at the beginning."}, {"text": "However, judges said that they picked Nana to be the next top model because she was the one who tried most to become a model."}, {"text": "They believed that she would be the best model in America if she made just the same effort consistently."}, {"text": "This example shows that people, companies, or interviewers like people who strive hard on everything than people who are in utter vanity of their intelligence."}, {"text": "To conclude, I firmly believe that good effort is the most important characteristic that a person can have to be successful in life--not only because making an effort for something can overcome any obstacles but also because people who make their best effort are admired by others."}, {"text": "There are many qualities that a good boss should possess."}, {"text": "Among the various qualities required to be a good boss, I believe that a boss's good persoanlity and a boss's previous leadership experiences are the two most important ones."}, {"text": "Frist, a boss's good personality allows him or her to gain respect and attention from the employees."}, {"text": "As one might expect, employees would like to work with a boss who is nice and understandable."}, {"text": "Employees respect bosses who have a patience, understanding, and tender minds."}, {"text": "They work better under such bosses because they don't want to let their bosses down."}, {"text": "On the contrary, employees would be less likely to work enthusiastically for their strict boss because such boss treats them with disdain."}, {"text": "Consequently, companies with many bosses possessing good-personalities are more likely to succeed because of the good relation between the workers and bosses."}, {"text": "For example, a recent study by Samsung, the most popular electron company in Korea, has shown that 78% of employees said that the only things needed in a good boss are as follows: the ability to cheer up the workers, and someone who truly cares about the employees."}, {"text": "This example shows that many employees agree with the idea that a good boss should have good personality."}, {"text": "Second, a boss with extensive experience in leadership roles usually makes for a good boss."}, {"text": "It is obvious that new bosses make several mistakes even if they are intelligent because they are new."}, {"text": "Most new bosses have no idea about the decisions and directives to give their employees."}, {"text": "Accordingly, a good boss should be someone who knows how to lead people or else the company will fail to succeed due to a boss's wrong decision."}, {"text": "For example, my dad, two years ago, received a lower salary from work."}, {"text": "He said that his work-team didn't sell many products that month because his new boss was so unfamiliar with everything."}, {"text": "My dad was very disappointed with his new boss and had wised that the boss had sufficient previous experience before being put in a leadership role."}, {"text": "Another new boss replaced that seat six month ago, but unlik the former boss, the new boss has numerous experiences as a boss."}, {"text": "Due to this change, his team is full of energy and is doing well now."}, {"text": "My dad's experience shows that employees want a good boss who is able to deal with many hard tasks and situations."}, {"text": "In conclusion, a boss with good personality and sufficient leadership experiences are the two most important factors that a good boss should acquire--not only because a boss's good personality supports the employees and allows them to work happily, but also because prior leadership experiences allows bosses to be prepared for any abrupt situations."}, {"text": "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------"}, {"text": "( I have a question."}, {"text":

skills."}, {"text": "People today are living in a global age."}, {"text": "It is mostly impossible to survive knowing only Korean; for example, English is fundamental tool in order to apply for large enterprises."}, {"text": "However, Korean schools still have not yet developed better environment or education systems for students to improve their English skills; they only teach English grammars, which are not that essential in daily lives."}, {"text": "This is why a number of Koreans are immigrating to America to learn how to communicate with Americans fluently."}, {"text": "Unlike an old-fashioned teaching methods in schools, English camps offer students opportunities to actually talk with Americans."}, {"text": "Students could naturally be friends with Americans even if they are not taught to speak English formally."}, {"text": "For example, my younger sister named Seung-mi who is 13 years old"}, {"text": "have been to the camp two times."}, {"text": "Before two years ago, my

sister also said that now it is easy for her collaborate with other friends in any activity."}, {"text": "This example shows that English camps enable students to improve their social skills."}, {"text": "In conclusion, among many reasons to join English camps, in my opinion, learning English and developing students' social skills are two most reasons why people want to participate in the camps-- not only because fluent speaking English ability is important in children's futures, but also because developing social skills are hard to practice in general."}, {"text": "There are many ways that television and movies influence people's behavior."}, {"text": "Among many ways that television and movies influence people, I firmly believe that inappropriate scenes in TV dramas or movies and

stories come out in public through TV, the most popular medium for advertisements, people eventually receive a point of view that such behaviors are cool."}, {"text": "Then, the number of people who

because everybody watches them on TV."}, {"text": "However, a number of girls are influenced by the models' appearances and believe that cool girls are the ones who are skinny and tall like glamorous models."}, {"text": "Therefore, because of this wrong viewpoint, many teenage girls develop eating disorders and spend fortunes to buy products that helps them to grow tall and become pretty."},
